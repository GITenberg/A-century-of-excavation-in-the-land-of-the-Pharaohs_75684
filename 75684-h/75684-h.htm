</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is somewhat remarkable that, in spite of the
considerable, if spasmodic, interest which is
taken in the results of research in Egypt, no
adequate account of the work of excavation has
ever been written. The student who wishes to
learn how, when, and where the facts and objects
which interest him were discovered, has himself
to excavate the desired information from the
innumerable volumes of reports issued by the
various exploration societies. It is much to be
desired that someone who is master of the subject,
and preferably, someone who has had actual
experience of the work of excavation, should tell
the story, not in a manner suited only to the ears
of experts, but so that the educated public on
whom in the long run excavation must depend
for its resources, could appreciate and enjoy a
narrative which ought to be as fascinating as any
story of search for buried treasure.</p>

<p>This volume makes no pretension to the discharge
of such a task. All that it attempts to do is
to outline the story of certain aspects of the great
work which has given us back so many of the
wonders of the ancient civilisation of Egypt. Its
omissions are, doubtless, many; but two will be
at once conspicuous to anyone who has the
slightest acquaintance with the subject. Nothing
is said of the Search for the Cities, which in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
closing years of the nineteenth century created so
much interest, and resulted in so many identifications
of sites; and nothing is said of the great
work of Papyrus-hunting which has added so
much to our knowledge of ancient life. These
two matters were left untouched for reasons
which seemed valid. In the case of the Cities,
many of the identifications of the ’nineties are
at present being questioned, and it seemed better
to leave the matter till something like agreement
is reached. In the case of the Papyri, the subject
has become so specialised, and has developed so
large a literature of its own as to render impossible
any attempt to deal with it, on the scale which it
deserves, in such a volume as the present.</p>

<p>It may be that at some time in the not far
distant future, when controversy has resulted in
more or less general agreement as to the sites,
these two aspects of Egyptian excavation may be
dealt with in a volume which may be a sequel and
companion to this. My indebtedness to many
authorities is manifest on almost every page of
the book; but I wish specially to acknowledge
my debt to Professor Sir W.&nbsp;M. Flinders Petrie,
D.C.L., F.R.S., not only for the kindness which
has allowed me to use the material of several of
the plates in the book (7, 9, 10), but also for the
constant inspiration and stimulus which his work
has given to me, as to so many other students of
the wonderful civilisation of Ancient Egypt.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STORY OF THE PIONEERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> story of the beginnings of research
into the wonders of antiquity in Egypt
is unique in at least one point. In no
other land does a conquering army march at
the head of the pioneers of exploration; but
the true beginnings of the century and a quarter
of research which has given to us so many
wonders from the Land of the Nile are to be
found with that amazing troop of learned camp-followers
who accompanied Napoleon’s army on
the expedition of 1798. The wonders of ancient
Egypt had never altogether been blotted from
the memory and the interest of man, as was the
case with some of the other lands of the Classic
East. The pages of Herodotus, never fuller or
more vivid than when he is dealing with Egypt,
prevented that oblivion; and therefore Herodotus
has some right to be named at the very beginning
of the story of the exploration of ancient Egypt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
as the pioneer of pioneers. But the world was
first really awakened to the richness of the
Treasury of Egypt by the colossal production,
twelve volumes of plates and twenty-four of
text, which was the result of the untiring labours
of Vivant Denon and his collaborators—the
famous <cite lang="fr">Description de l’Egypte</cite>—a work almost
comparable in scale and grandeur with the
monuments which it described. Few armies
have left behind them such a memorial of their
passage across a land—the more credit to the
man whose inexhaustibly fertile brain conceived
the idea of making even war subserve the interests
of science.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the tie with international
strifes and jealousies, which had drawn
the French savants originally to the Nile Valley,
remained unbroken for many years; and
questions of archæology were continually complicated
by questions of national pride and
prestige, so that the early story of Egyptian
exploration is not the story of pure research,
conducted for the love of truth and of antiquity,
but very often merely the story of how the
representative of France strove with the representative
of Britain or Italy for the possession of
some ancient monument whose capture might
bring glory to his nation, or profit to his own
purse. There are few more melancholy chapters
in the story of human frailty than those in which
the early explorers of Egypt (if you can dignify
them by such a name) describe how they
wrangled and intrigued, lied and cheated, over
relics whose mutilated antiquity might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
taught them enough of the vanity of human
wishes to make them ashamed of their pettiness.</p>

<p>Dr. Macalister has told us in the Cambridge
Ancient History that “it is impossible to give
any complete survey of the history of Egyptian
excavation.” This is true for the later period,
because the field is so vast, and the workers are
so many; it is not less true for the beginnings,
because it is impossible to write a history of the
scufflings of kites and crows—or rather, one
might say, of ghouls. It must be almost a
nightmare to the modern excavator, with his
ingrained appreciation of the importance of
even the very smallest object which may add
to the knowledge of ancient lands and peoples,
to think of the priceless material which was
destroyed by the undiscriminating zeal of men
like Belzoni, Drovetti, and their fellows, or if
not destroyed, at least deprived of half its value
by being torn from its historical place and
connection. These were the lamentable days
when interest in the antiquities of Egypt had
advanced but little beyond that displayed by
the gentleman of Addison’s first <cite>Spectator</cite>,
whose Egyptian researches are thus described
by himself—“I made a voyage to Grand Cairo
on purpose to take the measure of a pyramid;
and as soon as I had set myself right in that
particular, returned to my native country with
great satisfaction,” or by Lord Charlemont, who
according to Johnson had nothing to tell of his
travels except a story of a large serpent which
he had seen in one of the pyramids of Egypt.</p>

<p>In the early years of the nineteenth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
and, indeed, till Mariette in 1858 laid his masterful
hand upon the key of the great treasure-house
and allowed no one to spoil it but himself, there
was a perfect orgy of spoliation carried on, not
in the interests of science, but partly out of
vanity, and partly out of greed. Every important
or noble traveller had to add a few curios from
Egypt to his miscellaneous collection gathered
from half a dozen other lands, and sculptures,
inscriptions, and papyri of the greatest value
were thus uselessly dispersed in paltry private
collections, where, when they had gratified a
passing curiosity or ministered to a momentary
spirit of emulation, they were allowed to gather
dust through years of neglect, till at last the
futile cabinet of curios was dispersed, and its
items were lost sight of altogether.</p>

<p>Some collections, such as those of Belzoni,
Passalacqua, Drovetti, and a few others, had
better fortune, and were finally purchased for
one or other of the great European Museums,
which nearly all formed the nucleus of their
Egyptological collections in this fashion; but
the amount of unnecessary loss of what can
never now be replaced must have been deplorable.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">2. WALL OF CHAMBER, TOMB OF SETY I, VALLEY OF THE KINGS.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This “unbridled pillage,” as Maspero justly
calls it, in which the consuls of the various
European powers played an ignoble but doubtless
lucrative part, lasted for more than thirty years,
in spite of the protests of men like Champollion,
who could understand the irreparable loss which
was being inflicted on the infant science of
Egyptology by this mutilation and confounding
of the documents on which its future depended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Among its practitioners were one or two men
who were distinguished from the vulgar crowd
of papyrus, scarab, and mummy hunters by a
certain dim appreciation of the fact that the
treasures with which they were dealing had a
value greater than that of their price in the
curio-market, and who have added at least a
few interesting and remarkable items to the mass
of Egyptian treasure which the nineteenth century
accumulated, though our gratitude to them for
this must always be qualified by the fact that we
have no certain knowledge of what they lost
and destroyed in the process, but can only judge
from their own admissions that it must have
been far more than they preserved.</p>

<p>Of these men who may be pronounced guilty,
but with extenuating circumstances, the most
interesting, and perhaps the least harmful, was
the inimitable Belzoni, to whose unwearying
efforts we owe the opening of the Second Pyramid,
the discovery of the tomb of Sety I, the most
perfect example of the rock-hewn tomb of a
Pharaoh of the New Empire, and the magnificent
alabaster sarcophagus of Sety which is one of
the treasures of the Soane Museum, London,
besides several of the most important royal
statues in the Egyptian Galleries of the British
Museum. No one who wishes to realise what
the young science had to endure at the hands
of its first devotees can afford to neglect the
extraordinary farrago of vanity and pomposity,
ignorance and self-seeking, but also of patience
and endurance, and a certain inborn instinct for
what was either beautiful or valuable, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Belzoni has jumbled together under the sounding
title—“Narrative of the Operations and Recent
Discoveries within the Pyramids, Temples,
Tombs, and Excavations, in <span class="smcap">Egypt and Nubia</span>.”</p>

<p>Belzoni’s original object in going to Egypt
was simply to get “The Bashaw” to adopt a
hydraulic machine for irrigation work—a project
in which it is almost needless to say that he
failed; his knowledge of the precious material
with which he was soon dealing was nothing at
the beginning, and not much more at the end of
his “Researches and Operations”; he had a
positive gift for quarrelling with everybody with
whom he came into contact, Egyptian or
European, and a mania for imputing the vilest
motives to anyone who coveted any piece of
antiquity on which he had set his own heart;
but with it all he had the <em>flair</em> of the true explorer
for a promising site, and could foresee hidden
treasures where his rivals dreamed of nothing,
and with all his petulance he had a patience which
was almost inexhaustible. It was these qualities
which have made him the only explorer of those
unhappy days whose name is really remembered,
or deserves to be remembered, in connection
with our knowledge of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>As to his methods, these, of course, were
unspeakable, and the mere mention of them is
enough to turn a modern excavator’s hair white.
He finds the entrance of a royal tomb in the
Western Valley of the Kings, and proceeds to
open it—with a battering-ram made of two palm-logs!
As to his reverence for the mighty dead
of the past one sentence may suffice: “Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
step I took I crushed a mummy in some part or
other.” Again he describes his journey through
a tomb-gallery which the modern excavator
would have given his ears to see as Belzoni
saw it. “It was choked with mummies, and
I could not pass without putting my face in
contact with that of some decayed Egyptian;
but as the passage inclined downwards my own
weight helped me on; however, I could not
avoid being covered with bones, legs, arms, and
heads rolling from above.”</p>

<p>The object of these ghoulish journeys was
simply to plunder the coffins of their papyri,
which, of course, were marketable, though as yet
no one could read them; and there can be little
doubt that far more was destroyed than was
preserved by methods which were only a little
above those of the Ramesside tomb-robbers who
stripped the mummies of King Sebek-em-saf
and Queen Nub-khas of their jewels, and then
burned them. Such was Egyptian excavation
in the first quarter of the nineteenth century,
and in the hands of one of its most distinguished
practitioners, for Belzoni was an angel of light
compared with some of his rivals, native or
foreign.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the time for such
ignorant and sordid exploitation of the treasures
of the past was not to last for long; though it
lasted far too long for the welfare of Egyptology.
By 1822, Jean François Champollion, working
on the material supplied by the Rosetta Stone
and the Philæ Obelisk, and aided to some extent
in his brilliant achievement by the previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
labours of Akerblad and Young, gave to the
world the key to the hieroglyphic inscriptions,
so that the Egyptian monuments were no longer
dumb. In 1828 came the second great general
survey of the monuments under Rosellini and
Champollion.</p>

<p>It was now possible to read some, at least,
of the inscriptions, and therefore to reach some
approach to order in the classification of the
monuments dealt with. The work suffered an
irreparable loss by the early death of Champollion;
but the results of the expedition, presented in
the ten volumes of the <cite lang="fr">Monumenti storichi dell’
Egitto e della Nubia</cite> constituted a great enlargement
of real knowledge as opposed to
the conjectures which had previously held the
field.</p>

<p>For a time after the Rosellini Expedition, the
field was left to individual workers, of whom
the most notable were two Englishmen, F.&nbsp;E.
Perring and Colonel Howard Vyse, whose careful
measurements of the pyramids, especially the
great group of Gizeh, laid the foundation for
all subsequent study of these wonderful
structures. The work of Perring and Vyse was
done in 1837, and three years later came the
important Prussian Expedition directed by Karl
Richard Lepsius, whose name must always
stand among the foremost on the roll of
Egyptology.</p>

<p>Lepsius began with the Pyramid field at
Memphis, where his theorising on the method
of erection of the pyramids, though perhaps the
part of his work by which he is most generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
known, was of less importance than his investigation
of the Old Kingdom tombs of the nobles
in the necropolis, with its revelation of the life
and culture of the Egypt of 3000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Thence
the mission worked southwards, visiting the
Fayum, and carrying out investigations as to
the whereabouts of Lake Moeris and the
Labyrinth.</p>

<p>Passing on up the Nile Valley, Lepsius paid
special attention to the tombs of the Middle
Kingdom with their valuable pictures of Egyptian
life a millennium later than the pyramid period,
and also visited the site which has since become
so famous as Tell el-Amarna. Not content
with carrying his researches to the limit of the
Second Cataract, where Rosellini had stopped,
he pressed on through Nubia as far as Napata
and Meroë, the former seats of that Ethiopian
extension of Egyptian civilisation which gave to
Egypt its ill-starred XXVth Dynasty, while on
his return journey he visited the Sinai Peninsula,
where he discovered and published the very
valuable inscriptions left by the Egyptian expeditions
which for many centuries were sent to
work the copper mines at the Wady Maghareh
and Serabit el-Khadem. He thus revealed to
us the first chapter of the wonderful story of
Egyptian exploring and commercial activity,
whose subsequent disclosures have at last almost
succeeded in destroying the time-honoured myth
which represented the ancient Egyptians as a
cloistered nation, the Chinese of the Near East.</p>

<p>The <cite lang="de">Denkmäler aus Ægypten und Æthiopien</cite>,
published from 1849 to 1858 gave to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
world the results of the wonderfully fruitful
work of Lepsius, and has scarcely yet been
altogether superseded as a source of illustration
of the manners and culture of the ancient Egyptians.
“In the main,” says Dr. Macalister, “the
statement may stand, that Lepsius exhausted the
general topographical study of the country.”
Subsequent researches have done no more than
to add filling in to the broad outlines which he
drew with such care and certainty.</p>

<p>But now the period of superficial survey of
the wealth of material which Egypt offers to the
student was drawing to a close, and was to be
succeeded by the period in which excavation,
conducted with constantly growing skill and
attention to the most minute details, was to do,
as it is still doing, what no amount of superficial
cataloguing of the monuments of the land could
ever do, and to give us back, not only pictures of
the life of these ancient days, but the tools and
weapons with which the Egyptian worked, fought,
and hunted, the vessels which he used for all the
purposes of life, the jewels with which he and
his women-kind adorned themselves, the books
which they read, and the songs which they sang;
all the material from which, if we have the vision
and the insight, we may reconstruct the life of
those far-off days; and to crown its gifts by
calling up from the tomb the very men themselves
who ruled and warred in the land of the Nile in
the great days when Egypt was the first of all
empires, and her Pharaoh a god incarnate,
before whose golden sandals all the lesser kings
of the world bowed in the dust “seven times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
and seven times.” The pioneer of this work,
surely the most romantic and interesting, as it
has proved not the least fruitful, in the whole
realm of scientific research, was the brilliant
Frenchman, Auguste Mariette.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> story of the life-work of the man who,
more than any other, was responsible for
the creation of a genuine interest in the
great works of ancient Egypt, as distinguished from
the aimless or sordid antiquity-grubbing which has
been described in the preceding chapter, is one of
the romances of science. Mariette was one of those
men who, in the words of Cromwell, never go
so far as when they do not know whither they
are going, and in his early connection with
Egypt he was like Saul the son of Kish, who went
out to look for his father’s asses and found
a kingdom. Born in 1821, at Boulogne, and
employed as a teacher in the college of his native
town, he was drawn to the study of ancient
Egypt by the fact that the town museum had
acquired a fine Egyptian sarcophagus from the
collection of Denon, one of the savants who had
accompanied Napoleon’s Army of Egypt.</p>

<figure id="il_3" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 41em;">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In 1849 he was appointed assistant in the
Egyptian Department of the Louvre, and in the
following year he was sent out to Egypt for
the purpose of buying Coptic manuscripts. The
mission, a comparatively trifling one in itself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
was one of those trifles which often prove turning-points
in a man’s life; and from the moment
when he set foot on Egyptian soil, Mariette’s
future career was marked out for him.</p>

<p>The thing which determined his fate was a
passage from the old geographer and historian
Strabo. The god of Memphis, the most ancient
capital of Egypt, was Ptah, the artificer-god, who
was supposed to become incarnate in the sacred
bull Apis. As each successive Apis died, it
was buried with all the reverence and splendour
due to an incarnation of Divinity, in a special
necropolis at Saqqara. Later in the complicated
story of Egyptian religion Apis was identified
with the god of the Underworld, Osiris, and was
called Osiris-Apis, and the Greeks speedily
corrupted this into Serapis, and called the
burial-place of the Apis bulls the Serapeum.</p>

<p>Now Strabo, in writing his account of Egypt,
inserted the following passage about this ancient
bull-cemetery. “One finds also [at Memphis]
a temple of Serapis in a spot so sandy that the
wind causes the sand to accumulate in heaps,
under which we could see many sphinxes, some
of them almost entirely buried, others only
partially covered; from which we may conjecture
that the route leading to this temple might be
attended with danger if one were surprised by
a sudden gust of wind.” While Mariette was
pursuing his inquiries after Coptic manuscripts,
he noticed in a garden at Alexandria several
sphinxes, and shortly after, when at Cairo, he
came across several more of the same type,
while more still were found at Gizeh. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
plain that there was somewhere not far off some
storehouse of sphinxes which was being plundered
to furnish ornaments for the gardens of local
officials. The matter lay in Mariette’s mind
until one day when he was at Saqqara he noticed
the head of a similar sphinx sticking up out of
the sand. Searching round about it, he found
a libation-tablet, inscribed with a dedication to
Osiris-Apis. At once Strabo’s statement occurred
to his mind, and he realised that he was standing
over the avenue of sphinxes which the ancient
writer refers to.</p>

<p>Coptic manuscripts went to the winds. Without
apparently asking permission of anybody,
“almost furtively,” as he says himself, Mariette
gathered a handful of workmen, and began the
excavation. “The first attempts were hard
indeed,” he says; “but before very long lions
and peacocks, and the Grecian statues of the
dromos, together with the monumental tablets
or <i lang="la">stelæ</i> of the temple of Nectanebo, were drawn
out of the sand, and I was able to announce my
success to the French Government, informing
them, at the same time, that the funds placed at
my disposal for the researches after the manuscripts
were entirely exhausted, and that a further
grant was indispensable. Thus was begun the
discovery of the Serapeum.”</p>

<p>The passage is entirely characteristic of
Mariette, and the calmness with which he
assumes that the Government which had sent
him out to buy manuscripts will be quite pleased
to hear that he has spent all their money on
something quite different, and has committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
them to a huge excavation which was to last four
years, instead of to the purchase of a few parchments,
is particularly delightful. One wonders
what were the first thoughts of officialdom at
Paris when his letter reached the Louvre, and his
chiefs realised the kind of man and the irrepressible
energy which they had let loose in Egypt
to spend money on things which they had never
dreamed of.</p>

<p>His action at the Serapeum was typical of
his whole career in Egypt. When Mariette had
once reached the conclusion that a certain object
was desirable, nothing was allowed to stand in
the way. He went for his object, one cannot
always say straight, for he had caution as well as
daring, and knew how to use the wisdom of the
serpent, but with a resolute determination which
seldom failed in the end to accomplish its purpose;
and if regulations stood in the way, so much the
worse for the regulations. It was this self-reliance
and impatience of restraint which were
responsible for a good deal of the wastefulness
which undoubtedly was a marked feature of his
Egyptian work; but, on the other hand, without
these same qualities it is difficult to see how his
work could have been accomplished at all, in the
face of all the obstacles which were thrown in
his way by Oriental lethargy and corruption,
and by European jealousy and selfishness.</p>

<p>The great Apis-cemetery which was thus discovered
by Mariette’s happy disregard of the
limits of his commission is all that remains of the
original Serapeum. When the place was complete,
it comprised an avenue of sphinxes at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
least 600 feet in length, leading up to the great
temple of Osiris-Apis. No fewer than 141 of
the sphinxes were discovered, together with the
pedestals of others. The temple had entirely
disappeared, having, no doubt, been used as a
quarry for other building operations; but an
inclined passage led from one of its chambers
downwards into the vast vaults where for
centuries the bodies of the dead Apis-bulls were
given burial with splendours which rival those of
the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>The vaults belong to three periods. In the
first, which belongs to the XVIIIth Dynasty, the
tombs are separate vaults hewn here and there
in the rock; in the second, which is that of
Dynasties XXII to XXV, a long gallery was
excavated, on either side of which mortuary
chambers were excavated as needed; in the
third (XXVIth Dynasty) the gallery plan is
followed, but on a much larger scale. The
total length of the galleries of the XXVIth
Dynasty is 1150 feet, and the great gallery alone
measures 640 feet in length. In the side
chambers are the immense granite coffins, of
superb workmanship, which were provided for
the last resting-place of the Apis. Twenty-four
of these were found in the third gallery. They
average 13 feet in length, 11 feet in height, and
7 feet 8 inches in breadth, and weigh not less
than 65 tons apiece, magnificent specimens of
the engineering skill of the ancient workers who
transported these vast blocks from Aswan to
Memphis, a distance of almost 600 miles.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Serapeum set the seal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
on Mariette’s destiny. Henceforward his life-work
was to lie in the excavation and preservation
of the relics of that ancient land to which fate
had brought him; but as yet he occupied no
official position in the country, and was, indeed,
looked upon rather as an unauthorised interloper
by the native antiquity-hunters and the foreign
officials who encouraged the constant and shameless
pillage which had been going on for half a
century. It was in his struggles with these
vampires that the great explorer acquired the
habits of secret and solitary planning and working
which characterised his reign as chief of the
Egyptian Service of Antiquities, and the distrust
of all other excavators which led him to forbid all
such work even to the most famous scholars or
to his dearest friends, and to retain the right to
excavate exclusively in his own hands to the day
of his death.</p>

<p>“Forced to struggle for more than three
years,” says Maspero in his vivid sketch of his
predecessor, “against the jealousy of the dealers
of the time and the sharp practices of the Egyptian
officials, he was not long in learning and putting
into practice all the dodges which the natives
employed to track out their rivals or to cheat
the treasury. No one knew better than he how
to conceal a quest, to pack up the product of it
in secret, and to dispatch it without arousing the
suspicion of anyone.” Curious qualifications for
the head of a great Government department;
yet they served him well in what was really a
lifelong battle against the rivalry of men of
science, who, instead of encouraging him in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
efforts to set Egyptology on a firm foundation
in its native land, did their worst to rob him of
the fruits of his labours; and against the apathy
and indifference of his master, who regarded the
antiquities which his untiring servant unearthed
as valuable only because he could gratify a globe-trotting
potentate by the gift of some of them,
or in the last resort might raise a loan on the
precious treasures of his Museum.</p>

<p>Mariette’s appointment as head of the Service
of Antiquities was due, indeed, to a piece of
skilful wire-pulling in which de Lesseps and
Prince Napoleon, afterwards Napoleon III, were
concerned; and Said Pasha gave him the post,
not because he cared for his royal predecessors,
but because, as Maspero caustically puts it, “he
came to the conclusion that he would be more
acceptable to the Emperor if he made some show
of taking pity on the Pharaohs.”</p>

<p>An appointment due to no higher inspiration
than self-interest on the part of the giver
obviously depended largely on how long self-interest
coincided with the interests of the new
post; and perhaps the most arduous part of
Mariette’s task consisted in trying to make his
thoroughly Oriental master see that it was his
interest to maintain what he had begun, and
in overcoming the whims and caprices, and the
secret intrigues which continually threatened to
undermine his position and destroy the structure
which he was so painfully rearing. He never
could get a permanent grant for the work of his
department from the Egyptian Government.
When money was needed he had always to ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
it direct from the Khedive, who granted a subsidy
or refused it according to the mood in which he
happened to be at the moment. Again and
again Mariette had to close down his excavations
because he had unfortunately approached Said
when the Khedive was in a bad temper; but
though the continuance of work under such
conditions might have driven the most phlegmatic
of men, let alone a mercurial Frenchman, to
despair, he never for a moment lost sight of his
end. Repulsed once, he only waited a more
favourable opportunity to return to the charge,
and in the end he was almost invariably successful.</p>

<p>When his work is criticised, as it has often,
and not unjustly, been, as hasty and wanting in
thoroughness, let it be remembered that, with all
its faults, it was done under conditions which
would have driven most men mad, and that
thoroughness and minute care are not precisely
the qualities which are encouraged by the
knowledge that the exchequer is empty, and that
there is no prospect of being able to pay the
workmen unless one can catch a wayward prince
in a favourable mood. All things considered,
the wonder is, not that so much was overlooked
and left undone, but that so much was actually
accomplished under such maddening conditions.</p>

<p>His main object was to form such a Museum
in Egypt that it would no longer be possible for
the representatives of the European powers to
excuse their spoliation by the suggestion that
Egypt was unable to safeguard her own treasures
of antiquity. With this end in view he was
indefatigable in the work of excavation, doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
his utmost to gather from Memphis, Thebes,
Abydos, Tanis, and other famous sites, such a
collection of historical monuments as should
render the creation of a permanent home for
them a crying necessity.</p>

<p>Erelong he had so far succeeded that his
collection included fine statues of Ramses II,
the well-known Amenartas, the so-called Hyksos
Sphinxes, the Triumphal Stele of Thothmes III,
and a great mass of amulets from the cemeteries
of Memphis, Abydos, and Thebes. To house
these treasures he was provided with a set of
miserable buildings which were of no use for
any other purpose—a deserted mosque which
was falling into ruin, some filthy sheds, and a
dwelling-house alive with vermin, in which he
lived himself. Making the most of this heap of
ruins, he improvised pedestals for the statues
and cases for the amulets, and turned his early
training as a drawing-master to account in the
painting of the decorations of his crazy walls.</p>

<p>The incident which finally determined Said
to yield to the importunity of his energetic
Director of Antiquities was highly characteristic,
both of the daring and persistence of Mariette,
and the waywardness of the ruler with whom he
had to deal. One of the chief hindrances to
the erection of the Museum was the fact that the
excavations, though highly productive of objects
of historic interest, had as yet yielded nothing
in the way of gold or jewellery, and Said, a
thorough Oriental, cared but little for researches
which only produced inscribed or sculptured
stones. Early in 1859, Mariette’s workmen at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Drah-Abou’l-Neggah, near Thebes, discovered
the splendid gilded sarcophagus of the Queen
Aah-hotep. Mariette sent orders for it to be
sent to Cairo at once; but meanwhile the Mudir
of Keneh had laid hands on it, opened it in his
harem, and, throwing aside the mummy, took
possession of the fine set of jewellery which the
coffin contained, and hurried off by boat to
present it to the Khedive as an offering from
himself.</p>

<p>Mariette immediately set out on his steamboat,
the <i>Samanoud</i>, to meet the robber. Boarding
the Mudir’s boat, he tried to persuade him to
give up his ill-gotten goods, and when persuasion
failed he passed to threats, and from threats to
blows. Finally he triumphed, and took possession
of the treasure. Knowing the danger which
he ran of having his action represented to the
Khedive as sheer robbery of a treasure addressed
to the Royal Palace, Mariette took care to be the
first to tell the story to his royal master, and
did so with such effect that the Khedive
thoroughly enjoyed the joke, and laughed heartily
at the spoiling of the spoiler. He kept a gold
chain for one of his wives, and himself wore for
awhile a fine scarab which he afterwards returned;
but the rest of the treasure was reserved, as
Mariette wished, for his darling Museum, and
the Khedive, now convinced that the collection
was worth housing, gave orders for the erection
of a suitable building at Boulak.</p>

<p>Thus, by a happy combination of good fortune
and daring, the great explorer succeeded in the
attainment of at least a part of his heart’s desire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
The buildings at Boulak, however, were far from
satisfactory, and his heart was always set on a
dream-museum, which he did not live to realise,
which indeed has not yet been realised, though
the great Egyptian Museum has known two
changes of abode since his time, and is now
preparing for a fresh extension to house the
treasures of Tutankhamen’s tomb. In addition,
he had to be continually on his guard to see that
the priceless things which he had gathered with
such pains, and housed at such risk, were not
dissipated to gratify his patron’s passing whims
of generosity towards some favourite guests, or
sold <i lang="fr">en masse</i> to act as security for a loan.
Mariette had no intention of allowing his treasures
to be treated as pawnbroker’s pledges; but it
took all his energy and authority to prevent this
happening, for whenever Said was short of money,
which happened with unfailing regularity, his
first thought was to raise a loan on the Museum,
and it was only the Director’s personal acceptability
with his master which enabled him to stave
off disaster once and again.</p>

<p>The narrowest escape came just on the heels
of what had seemed the greatest triumph of his
life. At the Paris Exhibition of 1867, he had
secured the first adequate representation of
Egyptian antiquities. A small Egyptian temple
was built, preceded by a short avenue of sphinxes;
and within the temple were housed the finest
specimens of art and craftsmanship which Egypt
could produce. For six months all the world
admired and wondered; then came the blow.
Mariette had wrought too well, and made his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
treasures look too inviting. The Empress
Eugenie had cast covetous eyes upon them, and
the Khedive Ismail was informed that she
desired to have the whole collection offered to
her as a gift. Ismail, taken by surprise, and, as
usual, short of cash, did not dare to refuse; but
he had the sense to make his consent subject to
one condition. “There is,” he said to the
emissary of the Empress, “someone at Boulak
more powerful than I, and you must address
yourself to him.” It must have been the cruellest
of blows to Mariette thus to be wounded in the
house of his friends; but his resolution was
proof against both imperial wiles and threats,
and the collection returned in safety to its native
home. The explorer had saved the treasures of
the land of his adoption from the greed of his
native land; but it was at a heavy cost that the
victory was gained. The favour of France,
which had always been one of his main supports,
was immediately withdrawn, and for the next two
or three years Mariette found himself in disgrace
at the palace, and unable to obtain any support
for his schemes. Curiously enough, it was the
downfall of France in 1870 which brought him
into favour once more with the Khedive, and for
the last ten years of his life he saw the work to
which he had given himself steadily growing,
though on at least one occasion the proposal to
raise a loan on the Museum was revived, and
though Ismail’s grandiose plans for the extension
of the buildings remained only dreams, which
came through the ivory gate.</p>

<p>In respect to the excavations which he kept so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
jealously in his own hands, Mariette’s energy
was amazing, though its results were never so
carefully chronicled as they might have been,
and were sometimes scarcely chronicled at all.
The two greatest charges to be brought against
him as an excavator are, first, this lack of adequate
publication of his results, a huge mass of precious
material being gathered without anything to tell
the student its actual provenance, or its historical
connection, and, second, the craving for big
and imposing results, which led him often to
neglect the smaller but often more important
material which would have been of priceless
value to modern workers, but did not appeal to
him, and consequently got overlooked and lost.</p>

<p>With regard to the latter point, however,
we must remember that the knowledge of the
infinite importance of the small game of the
archæologist is a thing of modern growth, and that
it is scarcely fair to blame Mariette for not being
a quarter of a century in advance of his time;
and also that the difficulties of his position obliged
him to lay stress on the big and imposing monument,
even at the cost of neglecting what was
really of more value to the serious student.
Broken potsherds may mean far more for the
reconstruction of history than intact colossi;
but to the men in authority on whom depended
the continuance of the excavator’s work, they
were just-broken potsherds.</p>

</figure>

<p>Spite of all the defects of his methods, we
owe him an infinite debt, both for what he
accomplished and for what he hindered others
from destroying. The chief fruit of his toil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
apart from the work at the Serapeum and in the
necropolis at Saqqara, was the unveiling at
Abydos of the noble temple of Sety I, with its
exquisite reliefs, which will always rank among
the very finest work of the artists of the New
Empire. Besides the excavation of the temple,
he did an immense amount of work, very imperfectly
recorded, alas, in the great necropolis of
Abydos, where he unearthed over 15,000 monuments
of one kind or another. It ought not to
be forgotten either, though it often has been,
and though it has been stated that in his work
at Abydos he had no idea of the existence there
of any remains of the early dynasties, that it was
Mariette who prophesied both the discovery of
Ist Dynasty tombs and that of the great
subterranean “Pool of Osiris,” which is the
latest fruit of M. Naville’s work there.</p>

<p>Scarcely less important was his work at
Thebes, where he for the first time made some
approach to establishing the architectural history
of the great temple of Karnak from its foundation
under the Middle Kingdom down to the close
of building under the Ptolemies. To him, also,
we owe the excavation of the great temple of
Ramses III at Medinet Habu, and the first
beginnings of that huge piece of work which
M. Naville and his assistants at Der el-Bahri
only completed, after thirteen years’ hard labour,
in 1908.</p>

<p>How many of the visitors to Hatshepsut’s
beautiful memorial temple, who wonder at the
patience which unearthed this most exquisite of
Egyptian buildings, remember that it was Mariette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
who first gave to the world the most interesting
part of the whole building with its reliefs of
the royal expedition to the Land of Punt?</p>

<p>To tell of all his work at the thirty-seven
places in which he excavated would take a
volume, and not a chapter. One of his greatest
successes, though it dealt only with a Ptolemaic
building, was the excavation of the very perfect
temple of Edfu. He found it so completely
covered with rubbish that an Arab village had
established itself upon the roof of the ancient
sanctuary of Horus. Mariette succeeded in
getting these interlopers cleared away, and was
at last able to reveal the whole of a building,
which, while comparatively modern as Egyptian
temples go, is yet one of the most complete and
perfect specimens of Egyptian architecture, showing
the almost pure type of temple architecture
as it can be seen only in one or two other instances
in the whole land.</p>

<p>The great explorer’s work in Egypt lasted for
almost exactly thirty years. Before his death on
January 18, 1881, he had the satisfaction of knowing
that the work of which he had so well laid
the foundations would not be interrupted when
he had to lay it down. He never, indeed, saw
the accomplishment of his great life-dream, the
completion of a Museum really worthy of the
treasures which he had gathered. Sir Gaston
Maspero, his able successor, has told us how
that vision hovered round his death-bed, and
cheered his last hours; but even to-day the
great Museum at Cairo is scarcely worthy of
the matchless stores which it holds, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
becoming more and more doubtful whether
Cairo is the right place for a collection of such
priceless value. But at least Mariette accomplished
one thing which will never be undone; he
put a stop to the worst of the pillage of Egyptian
antiquities which had gone on unchecked for
half a century, and he established the fact that
the proper place where the historical monuments
of a great nation’s past should be gathered is on
national soil, where they are at home, and where
they have a value which could never be theirs
if they were scattered through a score of alien
collections.</p>

<p>A noble statue keeps his memory alive in the
Cairo Museum. Maspero tells us that a great
personage who visited the Museum asked whether
this monument was that of a Pharaoh or of a
modern individual; and when he was told that
it was the monument of Mariette, the founder of
the Museum, “Mariette,” said he, “I did not
know that the founder of the Museum was a
woman!” Such is fame, even in the land
where memories seem to endure longer than
in any other spot on earth. But Mariette’s
worth to the world does not depend on monuments,
though he had so much to do with them,
nor on great personages, though he suffered so
much at their hands all his life. It lies in this,
that he saved the relics of ancient Egyptian
history from the bottomless bog of international
jealousies and greed and insisted that a nation
with a great past had the right and the responsibility
to hold the treasures of that past within its
own bounds—in trust for the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>“Assuredly,” says Maspero, “Mariette is not
a model to be blindly imitated; and the man who
should imitate him to-day would run the risk of
committing irreparable blunders; but let anyone
who is tempted to depreciate him replace himself
in spirit in the Egypt of sixty years ago, and let
him ask himself how he would have acted in the
midst of the difficulties which would then have
assailed him on all sides; I believe that, if he is
an honest man, he will be forced to admit that
though perhaps he would have handled matters
differently, he would not have come better out
of the business. Mariette was the man who
fitted the time.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BEGINNINGS OF THE MODERN PERIOD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> coming of Mariette in 1850 marked
the close of the old and bad period of
reckless pillage in Egypt. His thirty
years of ceaseless struggle against difficulties
formed the transition period, in which the
foundations of the modern science of Egyptology
were being laid, but in which its aims and methods
were as yet but partially and imperfectly understood.
With his death in 1881, and the beginning
of the reign of his successor, the late Sir Gaston
Maspero, we may fairly be said to reach the
dawn of the modern period, in which new men
and new methods have completely revolutionised
the whole conception of archæology, and made it
one of the most fruitful aids to the reconstruction
and the comprehension of ancient history, and
above all the indispensable interpreter of the
life of ancient peoples. It seems fitting, therefore,
that at this point we should stop for a little
to consider what archæology is, and what are its
aims, its methods, and its materials; for with
regard to all these points there is, save in the case
of those who are more or less students of the
past, a very general haziness in the public mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>To the average man, archæology might be
quite satisfactorily defined as the study of old
stones and old bones, potsherds, and fragments
of corroded metal—a study presupposing, on
the part of the student, a curious and perverted
taste for the dry and the dusty and a disregard
for all the things which have in them the true
sap and joy of life. “Your true antiquarian,”
it has been said, “loveth a thing the better for
that it is rotten and stinketh”; and this judgment,
more pointed than polite, fairly represents
the conception which most people cherish of the
work of the excavator and the interpreter of his
results.</p>

<p>Now and again this crude and summary
judgment is shaken for a little by some wonderful
discovery which seems to hint that there is more
in archæology than the man in the street had
thought. Some Pharaoh, like Tutankhamen, is
found “lying in glory, in his own house,” as
Isaiah puts it, and the world in general begins
to turn in its sleep and dream for a while of the
romance of buried treasure. It may be suspected
that no small part of the interest awakened with
regard to Tutankhamen’s tomb arose from the
fact that there was talk of the money value of the
find running into millions sterling. A science
which can produce assets like that must be worth
attention. To tell anyone whose interest has
thus been excited that the money value of the
find, even if it has not been ridiculously overestimated,
as is most likely the case, is the least
important aspect of it, absolutely negligible in
comparison with its other values, is merely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
invite incredulity, polite or otherwise. In any
case the temporary interest of the find soon dies
away, and the public reverts to its old and normal
conception of the archæologist as an amiable and
quite harmless lunatic, and of his study as the
dullest and dustiest thing under heaven.</p>

<p>All this, of course, is just about as wrong,
and as stupidly wrong, as anything well can be.
It is, indeed, exactly the opposite of the truth.
The explorer, instead of being inspired with a
malignant disregard for the sap and joy of life,
is really so enamoured of these very things that
one of his main objects is to endeavour to make
the world realise them not only in the present,
but for the past also. His purpose, and his
business, if he has any real understanding of
the end for which Providence created him (for
there are some archæologists who have not, and
who almost justify the worst that the public
can believe of their science), is not the mere
gathering of facts, but the reconstruction by
means of these of the life of the past, for the
interest, the help, and the guidance of the
present. His work is not complete until he has
presented a picture of that ancient world in
which he is interested, not as it is now, a handful
of unrelated fragments of dry bone and dusty
papyrus and mouldering metal, but as it was
when the dry bones were alive, clothed with
flesh and inspired with spirit, when the words
on the scroll throbbed with the hopes and fears
of a living man or woman, and the corroded
bronze or iron was a sword in the hand of a
mighty man of valour, or a chisel in that of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
cunning sculptor. Unless he keeps this in view
as his real object, he is misconceiving his whole
purpose, and substituting means for ends; unless
he can to some extent accomplish this (no man,
of course, can do it completely) he is failing of
his aim.</p>

<p>But we are still waiting for our definition of
what archæology is, and what are the ways in
which it is to accomplish this desirable revivifying
of the past. It has been defined by a well-known
excavator and writer as “the study of the facts
of ancient history and ancient lore”—which is
very well as far as it goes, but omits, strangely
enough, the very point in which its author has
shown himself most keenly interested. To complete
the definition, one would need to add,
“and of ancient life in all aspects.”</p>

<p>The archæologist deals with ancient history,
and may prove helpful to the historian of the
past in many ways; he deals with ancient lore,
and may reveal material which is of the utmost
importance for the study of the knowledge and
literature of the past; but his main concern is
always with the life of the past, and his main
use to the world is to enable the present to see
and to realise the life of the past as it really was,
to give life again to the men of old so that they
shall no longer be names in a dry text-book, but
flesh-and-blood figures, and to do this for the
common man of the past as well as for his rulers,
so that ancient history shall no longer be the
chronicle of the deeds, great or otherwise, of
Pharaohs and monarchs of all sorts, but shall
give you the whole many-coloured tapestry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
life as it was in those far-off days with the fates
of common men interwoven with the glittering
destinies of their lords and masters.</p>

<p>“Archæological research,” says Dr. R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;S.
Macalister in the latest summary of its results,
“consists principally in the discovery and the
classification of the common things of daily life,
houses, personal ornaments, domestic utensils,
tools, weapons, and the like.” To have said
such a thing fifty years ago would have been to
make the scientific man of those days hold up
his hands in horror at such a degradation of
a science whose chief end was the discovery of
the great monuments of great men, and the
substantiation or correction of history by their
means.</p>

<p>To put the change of view in a word,
archæology has during the modern period become
human. It has learned that history never existed,
and cannot be viewed, in a vacuum; and that
quite as important for its right apprehension of
the facts is the realisation of the medium in
which the facts transpired, and which largely
conditioned them. “The true function of
archæological research,” says Dr. Macalister
again, “is to discover the conditions amid which
lived such heroes of old as we have mentioned;
to show them, no longer as solitary, more or less
idealised or superhuman, figures, but as men of
like passions to ourselves moving with other
men, in a busy world engrossed in its secular
interests, and making daily use of the common
things of life.” To take an illustration from a
familiar figure of Egyptian history, we know, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
a fact of history, that the favourite son of the
mighty Ramses II was Setna-Khaemuast, that he
fought in his father’s Syrian wars, that about
the middle of the reign he was high-priest of
Memphis, and that he died somewhere before
the fifty-fifth year of Ramses; in other words,
so far as the big records of the historical monuments
go, he is to us “magni nominis umbra,”
and no more. The real living interest of the
man begins for us with the discovery of a papyrus
of the Ptolemaic period, now in the Cairo
Museum, which shows him studying the old
inscriptions at Memphis in search of magic
charms, stealing the roll of Thoth from the tomb
of an earlier prince, just like a modern explorer,
and getting into trouble over the theft.</p>

<p>“The lofty personages,” says Maspero in
the Introduction to his charming <cite lang="fr">Contes
Populaires</cite>, “The lofty personages whose
mummies repose in our museums had a reputation
for gravity so thoroughly established, that
nobody suspected them of having ever diverted
themselves with such futilities in those days
when they were only mummies in expectation.”
That is just the point. It is not the impassive
mummies, with their reputation for gravity,
thoroughly well-deserved for the last three
thousand years, since they became mummies,
that we want to know; it is the folk who were
only “mummies in expectation,” who lived and
loved, hated and fought, and made fools of
themselves, like other people. And the business
of archæology is to show you these people, in
their habit as they lived, and in the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
medium which conditioned their actions. If it
cannot or does not do that, then it deserves all
the vivid abuse which Carlyle used to hurl at
the Dry-as-dusts of the past.</p>

<p>Now it is the supreme merit of the modern
period that it has been steadily learning the
importance of this aspect of its work among the
treasures of the past, till now it can say “nothing
human is foreign to me.” The change of view
is set before us very plainly in the contrast
between our modern histories of Egypt and those
of our forefathers.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, Maspero’s <cite lang="fr">Histoire
Ancienne</cite>, or Breasted’s <cite>History of Egypt</cite>,
and compare the brilliant pictures of ancient
Egyptian life which you will find in their pages
with the dry summaries of events which passed
for Egyptian history fifty years ago. What
has made the difference? Simply the fact that
in the interval the archæologist has been learning
that his business is not only or even chiefly with
the great historical monuments of the land with
which he is dealing, but, above all, with the small
things which made the background of life,
“the pots and pans,” as Dr. Macalister puts it,
“which are essential if he is to fill in the picture
of the ancient life of the region.”</p>

<p>The change of view thus brought about is
marked by a corresponding change of judgment
as to what shall constitute the chief object of
search in the excavations which reveal the past
to us. In the dawn of excavation it was the big
and imposing monument which was eagerly and
almost exclusively sought for—very naturally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
for it was only by the discovery of such relics
that the explorer could hope, in the existing state
of knowledge, to justify his work, and to create
the interest on the part of the public which would
provide him with the funds which were needed
for its prosecution. Colossal statues, granite
sarcophaguses, intact burials in Egypt, winged
human-headed bulls, alabaster slabs carved in
relief, cuneiform tablets inscribed with legends
of the Creation and the Flood in Mesopotamia;
such were the prizes which rewarded and vindicated
the labours of men like Mariette, Botta,
and Layard in the middle of last century. It was
all very natural and inevitable, as things then
were; and it is both unjust and unreasonable
to denounce the work of such pioneers because
they worked with the knowledge and under the
conditions of their own time.</p>

<p>The science of excavation and the knowledge
of its true objects did not exist when they did
their work; it had to be slowly and painfully
created by experience, and in the process it was
inevitable that many things should suffer and
that there should be much loss of material which
a better instructed generation would have known
how to value. These great men would doubtless
do their work very differently now; but it is
vain to criticise them for not possessing a knowledge
which nobody possessed in their day. We
owe them rather our gratitude for that they
accomplished so much in such unfavourable
circumstances.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, nevertheless, that the
methods of the early excavators, judged from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the modern point of view, were wasteful to a
large degree of the things which we have learned
to consider of supreme importance in the study
of the past. In their search for the big game
of excavation they overlooked, too often with
fatal loss to the science of the future, the common
things which would have made the indispensable
background to their more imposing discoveries,
and in many instances what they let slip will
never be recovered. To-day the outlook is
entirely changed, and the man who should
excavate on the lines of Mariette or Layard would
be a hopeless anachronism among explorers.
The excavator goes to his work now, not with
the hope of finding some great monument which
will confirm some doubtful statement of history
or disprove some theory of succession, not even
with the hope of discovering some store of
tablets which will let new light in on a dark
period. Such things may of course be found,
and are welcomed when they are found; and
such discoveries as that of the tomb of Tutankhamen
tell us that the romance of exploration is
by no means a thing of the past. But the modern
explorer has learned the infinite importance of
little things, and the results for which he mainly
hopes are such things as would be heartily
despised by the casual and uninstructed beholder.
Perhaps the change may be expressed most
simply by saying that while the explorer of two
generations back looked for colossi, his present-day
successor looks for crockery.</p>

<p>It may seem that from a science thus occupied
and concerned mainly with the infinitely little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the romance of the early days of exploration has
departed; but this is to misunderstand the situation.
The explorer’s work was never romantic
in the sense in which the average man understands
the word. The idea of the excavator as a man
who spends his days in exploring wonderful
underground chambers filled with the treasures
of the past, is just about as true as the picture of
the great detective who is always unravelling the
mysteries of crime by the most amazing strokes
of genius, and landing himself incidentally in
the most appalling situations. There never was
such an explorer, or such a detective; and the
life of the one as of the other is mainly one of
monotonous drudgery at which most of the folk
who talk about romance would shudder. The
great thrilling moments, when a discovery which
will excite the imagination of the world is made,
have always been far between, and the finding of
Tutankhamen’s tomb has shown that they may
still come to the modern explorer just as richly
as to his predecessor. But the true romance of
modern excavation lies in this, not that it can
reveal the dead monarchs of thirty centuries
back in all their splendour, but that by its patient
piecing together of innumerable small details
it can give back to us the actual life of the period
in which the dead monarch lived, and let us see
the order of his court, and what is far more
important to our knowledge of the past, the
traffic of the market-place in his cities, and the
intercourse of his land with the nations around
it. It is scarcely too much to say that because
of the minute care with which the modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
excavator has treated the minutest fragments of
the relics of ancient days we are better acquainted
with the life of the Egypt of the New Empire
than we are with that of the ordinary European
nation of the Dark Ages, though the latter be
more than two millenniums nearer us in time.
A science which can accomplish such a miracle
of resurrection can never lack the element of
true romance in the eyes of anyone who has a
real sense of the wonder of life.</p>

<p>It follows from the fact that the modern
excavator is called to deal with such a multitude
of matters, each in itself perhaps comparatively
insignificant, but each of importance, as an
additional stroke in the picture of the past which
is being slowly built up on the canvas, that far
more extensive qualifications are exacted of him
than sufficed for his predecessor. “Our explorer
in Egypt,” says Miss Amelia Edwards, “is only
called upon to be an ‘all-round’ archæologist
within the field of the national history: namely,
from the time of Mena, the prototype of Egyptian
royalty, who probably reigned about five thousand
years before Christ, down to the time of the
Emperor Theodosius, Anno Domini 379. Yet
even within that limit, he has to know about a
vast number of things. He must be familiar
with all the styles and periods of Egyptian
architecture, sculpture and decoration; with
the forms, patterns and glazes of Egyptian
pottery; with the distinctive characteristics of
the mummy-cases, sarcophagi, methods of embalmment
and styles of bandaging peculiar to
interments of various epochs; and with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
phases of the art of writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic,
and demotic. Nor is this all. He must know
by the measurement of a mud brick, by the
colour of a glass bead, by the modelling of a
porcelain statuette, by the pattern of an earring,
to what period each should be assigned.
He must be conversant with all the types of all
the gods; and last, not least, he must be able
to recognise a forgery at first sight. After this,
it must, I think, be admitted that the explorer, like
the poet, is ‘born, not made’! The wonder
perhaps is that he should ever be born at all.”</p>

<p>It seems, no doubt, a sufficiently formidable
catalogue of qualifications; but to Miss Edwards’
list others would now have to be added. For
the progress of investigation of the inter-relation
of the nations of the ancient east has broken down
the limitation which she imposed upon the
knowledge of her imaginary explorer, and the
Egyptian excavator of the present day must be
familiar, not only with all that has been mentioned,
but with the related work of Mesopotamia
and Babylonia, with the art of the brilliant
Minoan craftsman, with all that is known of the
enigmatic Hittite civilisation, and with the art,
both archaic and mature, of Greece, together
with a score of other related matters!</p>

<p>All this development of a science which has
grown almost within the lifetime of some of its
exponents from a comparatively simple thing to
one of the most complex and exacting of human
studies, has, of course, been the work of many
minds and hands. But if the name of any one
man must be associated with modern excavation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
as that of the chief begetter of its principles and
methods, it must be the name of Professor Sir
W.&nbsp;M. Flinders Petrie. It was he, as one of
the most brilliant of the exponents of his methods
has recently stated, who first called the attention
of modern excavators to the importance of
“unconsidered trifles,” as means for the reconstruction
of the past. Above all, it was he who
first taught us that for purposes of certainty in
the establishment of the succession of different
periods, the “broken earthenware” of a people
may be of far greater value than its most gigantic
monuments. And it has been men trained in
the principles which he established who have
during the last generation been doing the work
which has made the past of the Classic East
a living thing to the world of to-day. It remains
now to trace the outline of their accomplishment
in Egypt.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE PYRAMIDS AND THEIR EXPLORERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Of</span> all the works of man there is none
which has attained such lasting and
universal fame as the group of buildings
known as the Pyramids of Gizeh. For the
best part of five thousand years this group of
mighty structures has been one of the wonders
of the world, and the theories which have been
framed to account for their existence have been
more numerous than the Pyramids themselves.
Egypt has many buildings far more beautiful,
and perhaps as wonderful; but the Pyramids
are, to the great majority of people, the characteristic
buildings of the land, and whenever Egypt
is named there rises before the mind at once a
vision of three vast bulks of masonry squatting
defiantly on the rising ground above the Libyan
desert, as though challenging Time himself to
make any impression on their stupendous mass.
“All things dread Time,” it has been said,
“but Time itself dreads the Pyramids”; and
the very exaggeration testifies to the profound
impression which their bulk and strength have
made upon the mind of man. The mere lapse
of forty-five centuries would seemingly of itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
have made next to no impression on them; the
vandalism of man has done a little more; but
even the efforts of those who for many centuries
have used the vast masses as a convenient quarry
have done little more than show more convincingly
the power and skill of the builders
who reared in the beginning these huge
mausoleums around whose bases the workers
of succeeding generations have pottered and
scratched like children playing with toy spades
in the sand.</p>

<p>Yet though the Pyramids may fairly claim to
be the most famous and the best-known buildings
in the world, the ignorance in the average mind
with regard to them and the purpose for which
they were reared is still just about as general and
widespread as the fame of them; and the purpose
of this chapter is, first, to tell what, and how many,
and of what kind they are; next, what was the
end for which they were reared in the beginning
of history; and lastly, to recount something of
the efforts which have taught us what is really
known about them.</p>

<p>To most people the Pyramids mean solely
the great group at Gizeh; but though these are
by far the greatest and the most famous, they are
by no means the only pyramids, nor are they
even the oldest. The chief field, known as the
Great Pyramid Field, begins almost opposite
Cairo, on the western side of the Nile, at Abu
Roash, where is the pyramid of Dadefra (Razedef)
of the IVth Dynasty, and extends south along
the bank of the Nile for a distance of about
sixty miles to the Fayum, where lie the pyramids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
of the great XIIth Dynasty Pharaohs, the last
of the regular kings of Egypt to build pyramids
for themselves. Far to the south again in the
country which we know as the Soudan, there
lie two other pyramid fields, the one at Gebel
Barkal or Napata, near to the Fourth Cataract,
the other at Begarawiyah, the ancient Meroë,
between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, and a
little more than a hundred miles north of
Khartoum. These two fields have neither the
greatness of scale nor the historic importance
and interest of the Great Pyramid Field, for
they belong to the Ethiopian kings, some of
whom, for a time, reigned over Egypt in the days
of its decline. The Napata group belongs to
the earlier Ethiopian monarchs, who founded
the XXVth Egyptian Dynasty, which was finally
driven out of Egypt by the Assyrians in the
reign of Tanutamen, and to their successors,
who after the disasters of 661 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> maintained
the old Ethiopian sovereignty in the south; the
Meroë group belongs to the later Ethiopian kings
who reigned after 300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> As things go in
Egypt, therefore, these southern pyramids are
quite modern, nor do they belong to the most
interesting period of Egyptian history, and though
they have been long known, they are only now
in process of being investigated by the Harvard-Boston
Expedition under G.&nbsp;A. Reisner, whose
work at Begarawiyah is still unfinished. Our
attention, therefore, may be given solely to the
Great Pyramid Field.</p>

<p>Beginning with Abu Roash, the next site of
importance is Gizeh itself, with all its wonders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of IVth Dynasty work. Passing southwards,
we come to Abusir, with its remains of the
pyramids and temples of the Sun-worshipping
Pharaohs of the Vth Dynasty, lately excavated by
the German expedition; beyond these again
comes the great field of Saqqara, with remains
dating over a long period of Egyptian history.
The Step-Pyramid of King Zeser of the IIIrd
Dynasty is, of course, the most important and
imposing monument; but besides, there are
pyramids dating from the latter part of the Vth
Dynasty, a number of VIth Dynasty ones, and
the splendid tombs of many of the nobles of the
early dynastic period, so that, though the Saqqara
portion of the field cannot compare with Gizeh
in the size of its monuments, it is only second
to its northern rival, and surpasses it in the
variety and the pictorial interest of its minor
tombs. Still travelling southwards, we pass in
succession Dahshur and Lisht with their pyramids
of the great Pharaohs of the XIIth Dynasty,
Medum, with its remarkable pyramid of King
Seneferu of the IIIrd Dynasty, rising in three
stages, like a Mesopotamian Ziggurat, to a height
of 114 feet, and Illahun, where Senusert II had
his pyramid, and where the exquisite jewellery
of some of the royal princesses was found recently,
and reach the last of the series at Hawara, where
Amenemhat III, one of the greatest and noblest
of the long line of Egyptian Pharaohs, had his
last resting-place. In later days there were
pyramid tombs at Thebes and Abydos; but the
pyramid part of these structures was comparatively
unimportant, and they have, in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
case, left few traces behind. Indeed, after the
XIIth Dynasty the fashion of pyramid-burial
seems to have gradually died out, though we
know from the revelations of the Abbott Papyrus
that in the XXth Dynasty there were in the
Theban necropolis at least ten royal pyramids
belonging to kings of the XIIIth to the XVIIIth
Dynasty. Altogether there must be at present in
Egypt something like seventy pyramids of greater
or less importance, without reckoning the later
and less important groups of Napata and Meroë.</p>

<p>Passing by the Abu Roash pyramid of King
Razedef, we begin our survey with the magnificent
group of Gizeh, which to the ordinary man
are the Pyramids to the exclusion of all others.
Everyone knows, of course, what the Pyramids
are like, and has some rough idea of their surpassing
size, and perhaps the only way to impress
the sense of their vastness on the mind is to use
one or other of the comparisons which have
been worked out to illustrate the stupendous
scale on which they are built. To tell the
reader that the weight of the stones built into
the Great Pyramid is over six million tons is
merely to bewilder him; the vastness of the
business may be better appreciated when one
realises that a town of the size of Aberdeen might
be built out of the materials which Khufu
gathered together for his monstrous tomb, or
that if the stones were divided into blocks a
foot square, and these blocks placed end to end
in a straight line, the line would be long enough
to reach two-thirds of the length of the circumference
of the earth at the Equator.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>Khufu’s pyramid was originally about 481
feet in height, and each of its sides measured
at the base a matter of 755 feet 8 inches, and these
long lines were laid out and built with such
wonderful accuracy that the maximum error is
not more than an inch. “The laying out of the
base of the Great Pyramid of Khufu,” says
Professor Sir W.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;F. Petrie, “is a triumph of
skill; its errors, both in length and in angles,
could be covered by placing one’s thumb on
them; and to lay out a square of more than a
furlong in the side (and with rock in the midst
of it, which prevented any diagonal checks
being measured) with such accuracy shows
surprising care. The work of the casing stones
which remain is of the same class; the faces are
so straight and so truly square, that when the
stones were built together the film of mortar
left between them is on an average not thicker
than one’s thumb-nail, though the joint is a
couple of yards long; and the levelling of them
over long distances has not any larger errors.”
“Equal to optician’s work of the present day,”
says the same authority elsewhere, “but on a
scale of acres instead of feet or yards of material.”</p>

<p>The Second Pyramid is slightly inferior to
the first in size, its measurements being 472 feet
in height and 706 feet 3 inches on each side;
and its workmanship is also of inferior accuracy,
the errors in length being double, and those of
angle quadruple those of its predecessor, while
the masonry is of poorer quality. Curiously
enough, the sarcophagus, the core of the whole
vast building, was in the case of the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Pyramid one of the poorest pieces of work of
its kind in the period, and much inferior to that
of Khafra in the Second Pyramid. Spite of
its smaller size, which most travellers scarcely
notice owing to the fact of its somewhat superior
position, and its inferior workmanship, the
Second Pyramid is itself a world’s wonder.</p>

<p>Beside these great twin brethren, Menkaura’s
Third Pyramid, with its 215 feet of
height and its length on the side of 346 feet
2 inches, seems diminutive, though its partial
outer casing of granite may have given it a
richness of appearance which to some extent
compensated for its smallness.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a group of buildings
which, from whatever point of view they are
regarded, are among the most wonderful ever
reared by the hand of man, and which in sheer
bulk are by far the greatest of all architectural
works. What was the purpose for which these
stupendous bulks were built and maintained for
so long? To ask such a question was, not so
long ago, to let loose all the flood of vain imaginations
which always gathers about a subject which
is great and imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>The theories which have been framed about
the Great Pyramid in particular are almost as
monstrous as itself, but have none of its solidity.
Of these, perhaps the favourite, because of a
certain romance attaching to it, and because of
the reputation of some of those who have
supported it, is, or rather one should say, was,
that it was designed for an astronomical observatory.
R.&nbsp;A. Proctor, to whose advocacy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
idea owes a great deal of what vogue it had, has
told us that the entrance passage is so placed
that at the date which he assumes for the erection
of the pyramid (3400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) it bore directly on
the then Pole-Star, Thuban, or Theta Draconis,
when the star was on the meridian below the
pole, and further, that the great gallery which
leads up to the King’s Chamber was designed
to serve the purpose of a great transit instrument,
through whose open upper end the transits of
stars could be observed by astronomers occupying
seats on cross-benches laid across the gallery at
different levels! Still wilder are the fancies
which would have us see in the measurements
of the Great Pyramid divinely inspired revelations
as to units of length, capacity, and so forth, and
which gravely inform us that the granite sarcophagus
of Khufu is really a standard measure
of capacity, of which our British quarter is a
fourth part. It seems rather a pity in view of
this wonderful theory that Professor Petrie
should have just told us of the inferiority of
Khufu’s sarcophagus in accuracy to that of
Khafra, as such a fact tends to disturb the mind
as to the truth of our own measures; but it is
a sufficient indication of the flimsy nature of
the foundations on which all these theories
rest.</p>

<p>The fact is that no evidence worth consideration
has been brought forward in support of any
of them, and in especial that the idea of the
great gallery having been a gigantic transit
instrument (surely the most cumbrous and
inefficient ever designed) is absolutely negatived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
by the knowledge which we possess of the object
with which the whole building was constructed—an
object whose all-important condition was
absolute secrecy and concealment. To dream
that Khufu built a pyramid to secure his body
from discovery and destruction, and then allowed
its passages to remain open to the sky for years
that astronomers might observe the stars, and
tomb-robbers the plan of the pyramid, is to put
a fool’s cap on the whole business. The Great
Pyramid, like all the other pyramids, great and
small, was none of the extraordinary things
which we have been told it was; it was something
simpler and more wonderful than any of
them—the greatest witness ever given on earth
to the human craving for immortality!</p>

<p>There is no longer any doubt that all the
pyramids, from the first imperfect conception
of the form in the Step-Pyramid of Saqqara,
through the giants of Gizeh, down to the crumbling
heaps of brickwork which are all that remain
of some of the later fabrics, were built simply
and solely as tombs, and that their one object was
to render the resting-place of their royal tenant
as secure as precautions could make it from the
attacks of dynastic enemies or mere robbers.</p>

<p>The pyramid was just one pathetic expression
of that marvellously persistent passion which
gave us the tomb-chambers of Abydos, with
their storerooms for the supply of the dead
king’s wants in the Underworld, the Mummy
with all its wonderful elaboration of means for
preserving the shape and likeness of the dead
man, the Funerary Statue, with its amazingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
lifelike portrait of the man whose place it was
designed to take when time had reduced the
mummy to dust, and the soul still craved a
recognisable dwelling-place, and the long, rock-hewn
galleries of the Valley of the Kings, with
their pictured representations of all that could
help their owner through the dangers and
difficulties of the long journey to the Egyptian
Fields of Contentment.</p>

<p>No race has ever been so possessed by any
religious idea as was the ancient Egyptian by
the faith that it was possible to secure immortal
life for humanity beyond the gates of death,
possible, but difficult to the last degree, and
needing all the effort which could be given to
secure so great and so difficult an end; and the
Great Pyramid is just the most colossal seal
ever put on that creed, expressing, as nothing
else ever could, both the intensity of the conviction
and the consciousness of the extreme
difficulty of its attainment in actual fact. The
Egyptian Pharaoh built his pyramid as the
expression of his faith in life everlasting; he
built it as huge and as massy as he could, as the
expression of his consciousness of the numberless
difficulties and dangers which compassed the
road which led to the attainment of immortality,
and of his determination that, so far as human
effort could secure it, he would be secured against
everything which might prejudice his chance
of winning eternity.</p>

<p>The Pyramid, then, is a tomb, or rather it is
the sole surviving part of the elaborate and
complicated structure which the Egyptians of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the Pyramid period devised for the accomplishment
of this end of securing the duration of the
personality of its owner. For what we see now
at Gizeh and elsewhere is by no means what the
Egyptians of the early dynasties saw when they
looked upon the “eternal dwelling-places” of
their great kings, but only a fragment, which
by reason of its massiveness, and especially of
its form, has survived while the rest of the
fabric has perished. The complete pyramid-complex
was a development of the normal
Egyptian arrangement of tomb-chamber and
tomb-chapel. Each Egyptian of any rank or
pretensions was buried in a chamber, generally
underground, which contained his coffin of stone
or wood; but he had also another chamber
above ground, where the necessary rites might
be observed at the stated times, and the daily
offerings of food and drink made for his use
in the other world by his relations or by the
priests who were appointed for this purpose.
These two chambers were combined in the
“mastabas” of the Old Kingdom nobles, with
their shafts and their chapels. The pyramid
took the place of the mastaba, and as it developed,
the chapel, instead of being within the same mass
of building as the tomb-chamber, was built
outside, at the foot of the great structure which
protected the mummy of the king, as was fondly
hoped, from sacrilegious attack. This pyramid-temple
lay at the east side of the pyramid, and
in close connection with it. But the pyramids
were situated on rising ground, generally at a
considerable distance from the cultivated land,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and it was therefore necessary to arrange for a
convenient approach to them, instead of allowing
the priests or the royal relatives to scramble
over the rough ground. Accordingly a secondary
temple, or portico, was built down on the level
of the cultivated land in a position where it could
be approached by boats during the inundation;
and from this portico-temple a covered causeway
led up to the temple proper at the foot of the
pyramid.</p>

<p>We are to conceive of the pyramid fabric,
then, as consisting of these four parts, first the
part for whose sake all the rest existed, the
pyramid itself, with its concealed passages and
its carefully protected sarcophagus-chamber, in
which lay the mummy of the king in its granite
coffin; then the temple crouching at the foot of
the great tomb-chamber; then the long covered
causeway leading down to the lower levels, and
finally the Portico-temple on the margin of the
flooded river. One imagines the scene on the
feast-day of a great Pharaoh—the graceful and
gaily decorated Egyptian river-skiffs drawing
up to the stately columned portico on the river
bank, and landing their freight of white-robed
priests and gorgeous courtiers and princes of
the blood, the preliminary service within the
lower temple, and then the solemn procession
up the causeway to the temple proper where the
memory of Khufu or Khafra is celebrated, and
his wants for the other world supplied under the
shadow of the mighty mass of stone where the
bones of the great builder are laid. The Pyramids
are impressive enough to-day in their stripped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and gaunt majesty—one wonders if they could
be more impressive even in the days of their
perfected splendour. Possibly not, but at all
events the world can have seen few more imposing
sights than an Egyptian Pyramid Field such as
that of Gizeh, when its three giants were girt
with all the sumptuous fabrics which were part
of their essential design as their architects
planned them, and without which we are no more
seeing them as they were meant to be seen than
if we were viewing Salisbury without its spire,
or the Duomo of Florence without its campanile.</p>

<p>As to the sumptuousness of these subsidiary
parts of the pyramid-complex, we have fortunately
first-hand evidence. Little remains of the temple
proper of the Second Pyramid, though what there
is has been completely excavated; but the causeway
leading down from it has been traced, and
it terminates in a building which has been for
long familiar as one of the most striking examples
of the combined restraint and magnificence of
the Egyptian architects of the early dynasties,
the so-called Temple of the Sphinx, which is in
reality the Portico-temple of Khafra’s pyramid.
With its severely simple architecture of vertical
and horizontal lines, its great blocks of stone
absolutely without ornament of any sort, and the
richness of its granite monoliths and its alabaster
wall-surfaces, it tells us something of what must
have been the dignity and splendour of the Gizeh
Pyramid Field when it stood intact.</p>

<p>So far as the fulfilment of the object for
which they were erected is concerned, the
Pyramids of Gizeh are no more than a melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
monument of the vanity of human wishes, and
an illustration of how human cupidity or malice
will in the long run break through the most
elaborate system of defence. Professor Petrie
has suggested that Sir Thomas Browne was in
the wrong when he wrote that “to be but
pyramidally extant is a fallacy of duration,” and
comments upon that characteristic utterance:
“Khufu has provided the grandest monument
that any man ever had, and is by this means
better remembered than any other Eastern king
throughout history.”</p>

<p>That is so; and yet one cannot help
remembering that this was not at all Khufu’s
object in the rearing of his vast mausoleum. It
was not to keep his memory green, but to keep
his body intact that the greatest builder of the
world raised the Great Pyramid, and in that
simple object he utterly failed, as did all his
brother pyramid-builders great and small. The
evidence shows that not in one single case has
greed or hatred failed to overcome all the obstacles
placed in their way by royal power. Every
pyramid known has been rifled in ancient times,
probably not long after its builder was laid to
rest in his stately tomb, and the duration of the
mass of senseless stone, which bids fair to be
as long as that of the everlasting hills, only
mocks the hopes with which it was reared.
The pyramid remains; but the jewel for whose
sake so costly a casket was devised is long ages
since “blown about the desert dust.”</p>

<p>The story of excavation at the Pyramids of
Gizeh has nothing very exciting about it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
first excavators were, no doubt, the enemies of
the Crown, who, as Petrie has suggested, penetrated
into the burial-chambers in the troubled
days between the VIIth and Xth Dynasties and
wreaked their spite on the bodies of their dead
masters. Thereafter, through the Classical
period, the entrance into the subterranean passages
of the Great Pyramid was well known;
but the knowledge had been lost by the time of
the Arab Conquest, and the Khalif Mamun had
laboriously to quarry his way through the
masonry into the actual passages, leaving behind
him the great hole, which is still called “Mamun’s
Hole.” This was the beginning of the vandalism
which has done so much destruction at the
Pyramids of Gizeh, though the worst efforts of
human stupidity have somehow only seemed to
emphasise the dignity and grandeur of the great
buildings whose might mocks at the puny
attempts of the destroyer. After Mamun had
showed the way, his successors followed him,
and used the pyramid as a quarry. In 1356
Sultan Hasan used part of the casing of the
Great Pyramid in the building of his mosque,
and though his work may be, as it has been called,
“the finest monument in Cairo,” and “the
most perfect specimen extant of Saracenic architecture,”
its beauty is sadly discounted by the
fact that it was created by the robbery of the
most magnificent example of an architecture
more ancient and more noble. Hasan, or one
of his immediate successors, added to his crime
by stripping part of the casing from the Second
Pyramid also, leaving it in the partially despoiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
condition in which it now appears, for one of
his coins was found by Petrie deep down in
the southern foundation. Compared with such
barbarities, the indignities which the Pyramids
have had to suffer in all ages at the hands of
tourists, who have insisted on disgracing their undistinguished
names by scrawling them on these
great memorials of the past, are mere trifles.</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth century Caviglia
succeeded in penetrating into the centre of the
Great Pyramid, and he was followed in the
spring of 1818 by the redoubtable Belzoni,
whose account of the manner in which he
forced an entrance into the Second Pyramid is as
vivacious as the rest of his narrative. Belzoni’s
earlier efforts only resulted in the discovery of
one of the passages by which former explorers
had vainly attempted to force their way into
the pyramid; but his disappointment only
quickened his desire, and as he says in his own
inimitable way: “Hope returned to cherish
my pyramidical brains.” His workmen were
speedily set to work again at a new spot. “As
to expectation that the entrance might be found,
they had none; and I often heard them utter,
in a low voice, the word ‘<em>magnoon</em>,’ in plain
English, <em>madman</em>. I pointed out to the Arabs
the spot where they had to dig, and such was
my measurement, that I was right within two
feet, in a straight direction, as to the entrance;
and I have the pleasure of reckoning this day as
fortunate.” Even after the passage was discovered,
the removal of the blocks of stone which
obstructed it required several days of hard labour;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
but at last, thirty days after the work began, the
explorer found himself standing in the sarcophagus
chamber of Khafra. Besides the empty
sarcophagus, Belzoni found the evidence that he
had not been the first who had penetrated into
the secret of the pyramid, for in addition to
many graffiti on the walls of the chamber, which
were written in charcoal and rubbed off at the
slightest touch, there was an Arabic inscription
which ran: “The Master Mohammed Ahmed,
lapicide, has opened them; and the Master
Othman attended this opening: and the King Ali
Mohammed, from the beginning to the closing up.”</p>

<p>The Third Pyramid, that of Menkaura, was
opened in 1226 by treasure-hunters. “After
passing through various passages, a room was
reached wherein was found a long blue vessel
[the sarcophagus] quite empty.... They
found in this basin, after they had broken the
covering of it, the decayed remains of a man,
but no treasures, excepting some golden tablets
inscribed with characters of a language which
nobody could understand.” The disappointed
treasure-seekers were succeeded in 1837 by
Colonel Howard Vyse, some of the results of
whose discoveries are in the British Museum in
the shape of a fragment of the basalt sarcophagus,
and portions of a wooden coffin, purporting to
be that of “the King of the North and South,
Men-kau-Ra, living for ever,” together with the
remains of a man, wrapped in a coarse woollen
cloth of a yellow colour. “In clearing the
rubbish out of the large entrance room,” says
Colonel Vyse, “after the men had been employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
there several days and had advanced some
distance towards the south-eastern corner, some
bones were first discovered at the bottom of
the rubbish; and the remaining bones and part
of the coffin were immediately discovered all
together. No other parts of the coffin or bones
could be found in the room; I therefore had the
rubbish which had been previously turned out
of the same room carefully re-examined, when
several pieces of the coffin and of the mummy-cloth
were found; but in no other part of the
pyramid were any parts of it to be discovered,
although every place was most minutely examined,
to make the coffin as complete as possible.”
Unfortunately some doubt exists as to the coffin
being actually of the period which its inscription
claims, and the same doubt hangs over the
remains. It has been suggested that the coffin
is a restoration of the time of the XXVIth
Dynasty, and that the remains are not those of
Menkaura, but of one of the treasure-hunters
who lost his life in the attempt of 1226. Accordingly
we cannot say, as might otherwise have
been the case, that Vyse actually discovered a
Pharaoh in the great tomb which he had built
for his eternal abode. The fine basalt sarcophagus
was taken out of the pyramid by Vyse,
and shipped for England in 1838; but the ill-luck
which has dogged the pyramid explorations
attended Menkaura’s coffin also. The ship left
Leghorn on October 12, 1838, and was never
heard of again, though some bits of wreckage
were picked up off Carthagena.</p>

<p>Valuable work was done at Gizeh during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
years after Vyse’s researches by Perring and
Piazzi Smyth, though the careful measurement
work of the latter was somewhat obscured by
the fanciful theories which possessed his mind
on the subject of the purpose of the Great
Pyramid; but the most complete survey of the
Gizeh field was due to Flinders Petrie, who in
1880–1881 measured and planned the whole
site with the most scrupulous care.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting result of his
work, apart from the evidence which he gathered
as to Egyptian methods of working stone, was
his discovery, behind the Second Pyramid, of
the barracks in which the skilled masons who
were permanently employed on the building
lived while the work was going on. These
were capable of containing easily about 4000
men. The rest of the 100,000, who, as Herodotus
tells us, were employed in the building of the
Great Pyramid, were doubtless merely labourers
employed during the three months of high Nile,
when work on the land was impossible, to bring
up the blocks of stone and leave them ready for
the skilled hewers and masons to work upon.
As to the methods of these skilled workmen,
evidence of the most interesting kind was
accumulated. It was found that the great blocks
of stone were sawn by means of bronze saws over
nine feet in length, and equipped with jewelled
cutting points. The sarcophagi of hard granite
or basalt were thus sawn to shape with the most
remarkable accuracy, while they were hollowed
out by cutting rows of holes with tubular drills
also set with jewelled cutting points. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
chief difference between this kind of ancient
Egyptian work and modern practice with diamond
drills is that the ancient work is undeniably
superior to the modern. “Truth to tell, modern
drill cores cannot hold a candle to the Egyptians;
by the side of the ancient work they look
wretchedly scraped out and irregular.” “There
has been no flinching or jumping of the tool,”
says Petrie again, speaking of a drill core from
Gizeh, “every crystal, quartz, or felspar has
been cut through in the most equable way, with
a clean irresistible cut.”</p>

<p>Our wonder at the mighty mass of the
Pyramids of Gizeh, then, is not to be mere wonder
at the barbaric power which summoned myriads
of slaves and forced them to toil till by sheer
brute force they had piled up these mountains
of stone. Brute force, unguided and unorganised,
would never have built the Pyramids, though
millions instead of thousands had been employed,
and for centuries instead of decades, but would
only have led to disaster and confusion. The
wonder of the Pyramids is that five thousand
years ago there was found a race whose keen
intelligence so clearly understood the need and
the marvellous power of organised and trained
human labour, architects and engineers who
were capable of directing the energies of a hundred
thousand men without confusion towards a
clearly foreseen end, and craftsmen who were
capable of producing, with tools whose material
seems to us pathetic in its inadequacy, results
which put to shame the best achievements of
men using the finest modern tools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>The recent excavations in the Gizeh Pyramid
Field, directed by Dr. G.&nbsp;A. Reisner, have added
much to our knowledge of the subordinate tombs
of the period, and of the life of the times.</p>

<p>Moving southwards from Gizeh, we come to
the pyramid field of Abusir, passing on the way
the unfinished pyramid of Zawiyet el Aryan.
Of this pyramid, designed for the Pharaoh Nefer-ka-Ra
of the IIIrd Dynasty, nothing exists
above ground. The remains consist simply of
the trenches destined for the superstructure,
and the inclined plane leading down to the
mortuary chamber with its fine oval libation-trough,
or sarcophagus. Yet there are few
works of ancient Egypt which impress one more
with the sense of the magnificent power with
which these early architects carried out their
designs. “The whole,” says Maspero, “is
merely a <span class="sans">T</span>-shaped ditch, some 100 feet deep;
and yet the impression it makes when one goes
down into it is unforgettable. The richness
and the cutting of the materials, the perfection
of the joints and sections, the incomparable
finish of the basin, the boldness of the lines and
the height of the walls all combine to make up a
unique creation.”</p>

<p>The German excavations have resulted in
the discovery at Abusir of a curious development
both of the pyramid idea and of the early Egyptian
temple. It was already known from one of the
magical tales of the Westcar Papyrus, that the
kings of the Vth Dynasty were probably a
priestly line of usurpers, who claimed to be
related to the Sun-god Ra by direct descent—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
relationship which was henceforth claimed by
every subsequent Pharaoh, and embodied in
the royal titulary. The German Expedition has
revealed to us the unmistakable proof of the
devotion of the Vth Dynasty kings to the worship
of the Sun-god, and the unique form which their
temples took. The temple of Ne-user-ra, for
example, consisted of a rectangular court, 380 feet
by 280 feet, whose main axis ran east and west.
In the western half of this area rose the pyramid,
a curious combination of the idea of the mastaba-pyramid
of Seneferu at Medum and the later
obelisk. On a great block of building about
130 feet square by 100 feet in height, shaped like
a truncated pyramid, rose a squat brick obelisk
whose point reached a height of about 120 feet.
Roofed corridors surrounded the enclosure on
the other three sides, and probably provided
storerooms for the temple furniture, and for the
materials of the offerings. At the foot of the
pyramid an immense alabaster altar stood in a
small court surrounded by low walls. The
obelisk, on its truncated pyramid, represented
the Sun-god, and outside the temple wall, near
the south side, was placed the most curious of
all the furnishings of this curious temple, in the
shape of a great boat, built of brick, which bore
all the sacred insignia of the Sun-god in his
voyage across the heavens. The interior of the
temple walls was covered with sculptured scenes
of the life created by the god, scenes from the
river, the swamps, the fields and the desert,
these being the earliest specimens of such mural
decorations in any Egyptian temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>The next stage of the Great Pyramid Field is
at Saqqara, where the chief feature is the most
ancient, and save for the monsters of Gizeh, the
most famous of all the pyramids, the Stepped-Pyramid
of King Zeser of the IIIrd Dynasty,
the earliest great stone structure in the world.
This remarkable building was probably the work
of Zeser’s famous counsellor and architect
Imhotep, the typical wise man of early Egypt,
whose counsel was “as though one inquired at
the oracle of God,” and who was subsequently
deified and became the patron-deity of the scribes.</p>

<p>The tomb which he reared for his master
(who had also another great tomb at Bet-Khallaf)
was built in six stages, stands about 197 feet in
height, and has the peculiarity that its base is
not a square but a rectangle, measuring 394 by
351 feet. But though the interest attaching to
man’s first great piece of stonework must always
be great, the actually living interest at Saqqara
attaches not so much to Zeser’s hoary and imposing
tomb, as to the comparatively insignificant
and decayed pyramids of the Vth and VIth
Dynasty kings, Unas, Teti, Pepy I, Merenra,
and Pepy II. Mere heaps of rubble and sand as
they seem, with none of the splendour of construction
or greatness of scale of the Gizeh group,
these monuments of the time when the royal
power of the Old Kingdom was beginning to
decline are yet of supreme value; for they are
the first pyramids in which inscriptions have
been found, and the long religious texts discovered
in them, and now known as the Pyramid Texts,
are unique and of infinite importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>Up to the end of his career, Mariette believed
that the pyramids were dumb, as the Gizeh
group had proved to be, and therefore looked
upon the attempt to open any of the Saqqara
group as mere waste labour. Maspero, however,
believed otherwise, and the opening of the
pyramid of Pepy I in 1880 proved that he was
right. The other pyramids named proved also
to be inscribed, and altogether the five pyramids
give us a series of religious texts covering a
period of about one hundred and fifty years, or
perhaps one hundred and eighty, from 2825 to
2644 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, or, on Petrie’s dating, from 4275 to
4090 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Even taking the later dates, these
Pyramid Texts form by far the earliest large body
of religious writings which have come down from
any part of the ancient East, and their importance
as sources of knowledge as to the beliefs of the
earliest Dynastic period can scarcely be overrated.</p>

<p>Apart from the interest of its pyramids,
Saqqara has proved of infinite value to the
student of ancient Egyptian life because of the
richness of its necropolis in the great mastaba
tombs of the nobles of the Old Kingdom. Since
Mariette’s excavation of the tomb of Ti, who was
a great man in his day, and architect to two
successive kings of the Vth Dynasty, Nefer-ari-ka-ra
and Ne-user-ra, the sculptures of this
splendid tomb, and those, scarcely less remarkable,
of the tombs of Ptah-hetep, Mereruka and
Kagemni, have been recognised as among the
most precious accomplishments of ancient art.</p>

<p>Apart altogether from their artistic value,
their importance as first-hand documents for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
the reconstruction of life in ancient Egypt five
thousand years ago is supreme, for their representations,
executed with infinite vivacity and
spirit, cover almost every department of Egyptian
life. The great man is represented as surrounded
by all the busy life which ministered to his comfort
when he was on earth, or engaged in the
sports and diversions which were his relaxation
in the intervals of his public duties, sailing,
fishing, fowling, or hippopotamus-hunting among
the Nile swamps. Farm life, with its changing
activities according to the season, and all its
peaceful and beautiful incident, is faithfully
depicted, so that the crops which the Egyptian
landowner grew and the stock he kept can be
perfectly known; while all the crafts which were
necessary to the upkeep of a great estate are also
depicted with abundant detail and a charming
directness and dash. The tomb-paintings of the
New Empire at Thebes are much and deservedly
admired; but even they must yield in freshness
and charm to these pictures from the dawn of
history, which have the dew of youth still upon
them, and all the vigour of an art which is already
quite sure of itself, but has not had the time to
grow stale.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From Dahshur down to Illahun and Hawara
lie the pyramids of the great kings of the XIIth
Dynasty, who, though Thebans, realised that
the centre of gravity of the national government
must be further north, and who therefore made
their royal residence between Memphis and the
Fayum. The earlier kings of the dynasty,
Amenemhat I and Senusert I, had their pyramids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
at Lisht; Amenemhat II and Senusert III
preferred Dahshur for their resting-place; while
Senusert II chose Lahun, and Amenemhat III
Hawara, where he could sleep beside the great
works which he had wrought at Lake Moeris for
the welfare of his land. The XIIth Dynasty
pyramids are not imposing externally. The
ruinous piles of brickwork at Dahshur and Lahun
look more like gigantic ant-heaps than true
pyramids; yet they were the work of kings who
in their own way were quite as powerful as
the pyramid-builders of the IVth Dynasty, and
the detail of the inner workmanship of the
sarcophagus chambers is quite as remarkable
as anything to be seen at Gizeh. Part of the
reason for the difference is a change, not so much
in the ideal for which the pyramid was constructed
(for that remained constant throughout
the history of Egypt), but in the conception of
the best means towards the realising of the
ideal. “It seems,” says Petrie, describing the
change which Senusert II introduced in his
pyramid at Lahun, “that the pyramids of the
earlier kings had fallen a prey to violence already,
the signs of personal spite in the destructions are
evident. Therefore Senusert II determined to
abandon the old system of a north entrance in
the face, and to conceal the access to the interior
by a new method.” His method was to excavate
his sarcophagus chamber entirely out of the
solid rock on which the pyramid was founded,
and to place the entrance to the passage which
led to the chamber outside of the pyramid
altogether. The shaft which gives access to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
passage actually opens out on the plain, beneath
the floor of the tomb of one of the princesses
of the dynasty. Inside the rock-hewn chamber
which was protected with such care, and which
was splendidly lined with red granite, stood the
red granite sarcophagus, “exquisitely wrought,”
says Petrie, “the errors of flatness and straightness
being matters of thousandths of an inch.”</p>

<p>Yet the cunning and the skill of the XIIth
Dynasty architects and masons proved as helpless
as the massive power of the IVth Dynasty to
protect the dead monarchs from the ravages of
hatred or greed. Nor were the elaborate precautions
of Amenemhat III any more successful
than those of his grandfather had been. Petrie’s
description of the construction of the inner
passages of Amenemhat’s pyramid at Hawara
reads like something planned to be a nightmare
to explorers. “The explorer,” he says, “who
had found the entrance in the unusual place on
the south side, descended a long staircase, which
ended in a dumb chamber. The roof of this,
if slid aside, showed another passage, which was
filled with blocks. This was a mere blind, to
divert attention from the real passage, which
stood ostentatiously open. A plunderer has,
however, fruitlessly mined his way through all
these blocks. On going down the real passage,
another dumb chamber was reached; another
sliding trap-door was passed; another passage
led to a third dumb chamber; a third trap-door
was passed; and now a passage led along past
one side of the real sepulchre; and to amuse
explorers, two false wells open in the passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
floor, and the wrong side of the passage is filled
with masonry blocks fitted in. Yet by some
means the plunderers found a cross trench in
the passage floor which led to the chamber.
Here another device was met. The chamber
had no door, but was entered solely by one of
the immense roof-blocks, weighing 45 tons,
being left raised, and afterwards dropped into
place on closing the pyramid.” One would have
imagined that with such precautions the sleep of
Amenemhat would surely be undisturbed; but
when Petrie in 1889 tunnelled his way through
the roofing-beams of the sepulchral chamber
he found that an early plunderer had anticipated
him by mining right through the great 45-ton
block. “The royal interments had been entirely
burnt; and only fired grains of diorite and
pieces of lazuli inlaying showed the splendour of
the decorations of the coffins.”</p>

<p>Here, as in all the other cases of the pyramids,
the very elaboration of the means adopted for
the preservation of the dead body of the king
had only whetted the appetite of the spoiler and
destroyer, and little has survived from the XIIth
Dynasty pyramids to reward the modern explorer.
The great finds in the XIIth Dynasty pyramid
fields were all from outside the pyramids. Of
these one of the most valuable, though by no
means the most spectacular, was Petrie’s discovery,
near the pyramid of Senusert II at
Lahun, of the town, created specially for the
occasion, in which the workmen of Senusert had
lived with their staff of architects, overseers, and
scribes, while the pyramid was under construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>The little town of Ha-hetep-Senusert, Kahun
as it is now called, gives us the most complete
instance extant of the character of an Egyptian
town of the Middle Kingdom. It occupied an
area of about 18 acres, and the plans of the narrow
streets and of the houses, mostly small and closely
crowded together, though there are exceptions
to this rule, have been completely wrought out.
Much that is interesting in the way of pottery,
tools, and papyri came from the ruins of the
deserted houses of the little pyramid-town,
whose existence seems to have been a very brief
one, probably not much longer than was necessary
for the erection of the pyramid.</p>

<p>Again it was not in Amenemhat’s elaborately
devised pyramid at Hawara, but in the Roman
cemetery to the north of it, that the great find was
made which has made Hawara famous in the
history of ancient Egyptian art, and has given us
one of the most valuable contributions ever
made to our knowledge of the processes and
technique of ancient painting. A cemetery which
dates mostly from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> instead of from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> has
in general comparatively little attraction to the
explorer in ancient Egypt, unless he be a specialist
in the Greco-Roman Period. Accordingly, when
Petrie in 1888 found that the cemetery in question
was of the first and second centuries <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, he was
on the point of giving it up as not worth working,
when one day a mummy was found with a painted
portrait on a wooden panel inserted above
its face. The picture was a beautifully drawn
head of a girl, painted in soft tones, and quite
un-Egyptian in its style. It proved to be only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the forerunner of a whole series of similar
portraits, of which about sixty were found before
the excavations closed. The work was resumed
in 1911 with further success. The portraits
are of varying merit, and of even the best of them
it has to be remembered that we are not dealing
with the product of the studio of a skilled artist,
but only with that of the workshop of a firm of
local undertakers, who supplied funerary portraits
just as they supplied coffins. All things considered
the quality of the work is wonderfully
good, and the information given by these panel
pictures as to the methods of the ancient painters
is of the highest importance. Before the Hawara
discoveries, we were left very much in the dark
as to how Apelles, Zeuxis, Polygnotus and their
companions and rivals produced the masterpieces
which have only survived in the literary
descriptions of their contemporaries. The
Hawara pictures may be very far, even the best
of them, from being masterpieces; but at least
they tell us what were the methods by which
the great painters of ancient Greece produced
the pictures which were considered the equals
in artistic merit of the statues which are now
the wonder of the world. The manner in
which they were painted is often described as
“encaustic,” but this is an incorrect description
of portraits which, so far as can be judged, were
simply painted with melted coloured wax, laid
on with a free brush, each tint being laid on as
a solid body, and not subjected to subsequent
glazings.</p>

<p>The XIIth Dynasty pyramid fields at Dahshur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
and Illahun have yielded two of the most remarkable
finds of Egyptian jewellery which have ever
been made, and the results of the work of
de Morgan and Petrie in this respect are such
as to increase our admiration for the marvellous
skill of the craftsmen of the Middle Kingdom.
It was in 1894 and 1895 that de Morgan’s workmen,
clearing up the area round the XIIth
Dynasty pyramids at Dahshur, found in the
tombs of the princesses of the royal house one
of the most wonderful stores of jewellery which
have ever rewarded excavation. The two most
notable pieces of the treasure were the diadems
of the princess Khnumit, the most exquisite
examples of the skill of the goldsmith ever
worn. “The floret crown,” says Petrie, “is
perhaps the most charmingly graceful head-dress
ever seen; the fine wavy threads of gold
harmonised with the hair, and the delicate little
flowers and berries seem scattered with the wild
grace of Nature. Each floret is held by two wires
crossing in an eye behind it, and each pair of
berries has likewise an eye in which the wires
cross. The florets are not stamped, but each
gold socket is made by hand for the four inserted
stones. The berries are of lazuli. In no instance,
however small, was the polishing of the
stone done in its cloison; it was always finished
before setting.” The other diadem is more
conventional, but scarcely less beautiful. Eight
rosettes of gold and precious stones are surmounted
with motives of lyre shape terminating
in golden flowers, and the rosettes are united
by long links also bearing jewelled rosettes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
The stones of the two crowns are lapis-lazuli,
carnelian, red jasper, and green felspar. Along
with the diadems were found gold pectorals of
fine design and execution, bearing the cartouches
of Senusert II, Senusert III, and
Amenemhat III, and various other articles of
jewellery, and even the famous jewellery of
Queen Aah-hotep, so long the typical specimen
of Egyptian craftsmanship, must yield the palm
to the earlier work in beauty of design and
daintiness of execution.</p>

<p>The second discovery came in February,
1914, when Professor Petrie’s workmen were
clearing a rifled tomb belonging to the “Royal
daughter Sat-Hathor-ant” at Lahun near the
pyramid of Senusert II. How the treasure of
Lahun had ever escaped the plunderers who had
rifled the tomb is a mystery. “The tomb had
been attacked,” says Petrie; “the long and
heavy work of shifting the massive granite lid
of the sarcophagus, and breaking it away, had
been achieved; yet all this gold was left in the
recess of the passage untouched.... The whole
treasure seems to have been stacked in the recess
at the time of the burial, and to have gradually
dropped apart as the wooden caskets decayed
in course of years, with repeated flooding of
storm water and mud slowly washed into the
pit.... The whole treasure was standing in
an open recess, within arm’s reach of the gold-seekers,
while they worked at breaking open
the granite sarcophagus.” We can only be
thankful that all the luck did not go to the ancient
robber, and that, like his earlier companion who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
left the arm of the Ist Dynasty queen, with its
jewelled bracelets, at Abydos, he overlooked
something to tell a later age of the skill and taste
of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>The chief feature of the Lahun find was a
perfect specimen of a royal diadem, bearing the
uræus on its front. No actual specimen of the
famous double crown of Egypt has ever come
to light, familiar though its appearance may be,
probably because its materials were of a perishable
nature; but the diadem of Lahun gives us a
unique specimen of such a crown as Egyptian
royalty may often have worn in preference to
the cumbrous mitre so frequently figured. “It
is formed by a broad band of highly burnished
gold over an inch wide, and large enough to
pass round the bushy wig worn in the XIIth
Dynasty. The uræus is of open work, inlaid
with lazuli and carnelian; the head is of lazuli,
which was found loose in the mud. Around
the polished band were affixed fifteen rosettes,
each composed of four flowers with intermediate
buds. At the back a tube of gold was riveted
on to the band, and into that fitted a double
plume of sheet gold, the stem of which slipped
through a flower of solid gold. The thickness
of the plumes was such that they would wave
slightly with every movement of the head. At
the back and sides of the crown were streamers
of gold, which hung from hinges attached to
the rosettes. The whole construction was over
a foot and a half high.” Such was an Egyptian
diadem in the great days of the Middle Kingdom,
and surely never did a royal head wear a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
graceful emblem of sovereignty than that which
came so strangely to light in 1914.</p>

<p>Along with the crown were found two
pectorals, one of Senusert II, the other of
Amenemhat III, of even finer design than the
famous pectorals of Dahshur. “The earlier
pectoral is inlaid with minute feathering of
lazuli and turquoise; the later with a different
feathering of lazuli and white paste, which has
probably been green.... They were probably
suspended by necklaces of the very rich deep
amethyst beads which were found here.” With
the pectorals went several gold and jewelled
collars and necklets, and broad armlets of golden
bars with beads of carnelian and turquoise, and
inlaid clasps bearing the royal cartouche, and
a number of other articles, amulets and toilet
utensils, including a silver mirror with a handle
of obsidian, inlaid with bands of plaited gold,
and bearing a cast gold head of Hathor. Another
item came to light from Lahun in 1920 in the
shape of the royal uræus of Senusert II, “a
massive gold casting, with inlay of carnelian and
lazuli, a head of lazuli, and eyes of garnet in gold
setting,” which was found near the sepulchral
chamber in the heart of the pyramid, amidst a
heap of dust and chips of stone. Doubtless
this is the royal emblem which adorned the brow
of Senusert when he was laid to rest in his
pyramid, though how it escaped the notice of
the robbers who plundered his tomb is as great
a mystery as the escape of the treasure of
Sat-Hathor-ant.</p>

<p>Thus the pyramids of the XIIth Dynasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
monarchs, insignificant as they may seem in
comparison with the gigantic piles of Gizeh,
have proved in their way no less interesting than
the colossal work of Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura.
Indeed each of the pyramid groups has
its own characteristics, and has given its own
contribution to our knowledge of the successive
periods of early Egyptian history. To the mighty
structures of the IVth Dynasty we owe the
revelation of the marvellous organisation of the
Egyptian kingdom, and the skill with which its
resources could be concentrated on a single
gigantic task. To the less imposing buildings
of the Vth and VIth Dynasties we owe something
perhaps even more precious—the revelation of
the thoughts which were shaping themselves in
the mind of man in these most ancient days
with regard to the soul and its life beyond the
grave. To those of the XIIth Dynasty we owe
the evidence of the skill which shaped the marvellous
red-granite sarcophagus of Senusert II,
or the great quartzite funeral chamber of
Amenemhat III, and the union of luxury with
the finest taste which created the jewellery of
Dahshur and Lahun. It may be questioned if
even the tomb of Tutankhamen, with all its
mass of splendour, will have anything to show
us which can surpass in grace and dignity the
diadems of Khnumit and Sat-Hathor-ant, or
in exquisiteness of finish their pectorals and
armlets.</p>

<p>With the decline of the royal power at the
close of the XIIth Dynasty, the age of the
pyramid-builders closes. Already the taste for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
these huge structures was being modified, as
it was continually found how powerless they
were to accomplish the great end for which they
were designed—the protection of the dead body
of the king from the hatred of his enemies or the
greed of the professional tomb-robber. The
decay of the royal power which is so marked
even in the beginnings of the dark period which
now ensues no doubt completed a process which
disillusionment had already begun; and when
Egypt once more found herself under a strong
and stable government, the Theban kings who
delivered her from the Hyksos tyranny had
recourse to another device for securing the
continuity of existence after death, and instead
of piling mountains of stone or brick above
their sepulchral chambers, were hewing in the
Valley of the Kings the galleries and halls which
have been yielding up their secrets in our time
for the wonder and instruction of the world.</p>

<span class="subhead">WORK AMONG THE TEMPLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Scarcely</span> less famous than the pyramids,
and of far greater beauty, are the
splendid temples whose ruins extend
from Heliopolis, close to the Delta, to Philæ,
where the beautiful shrines of Isis, exquisite in
their setting, even if of late date for Egypt, are
now becoming only memories of a beauty which
has had to yield to the claims of present-day life.
Egypt, almost equally with Greece, may claim to
be the Land of Temples; and certainly no other
land of the ancient East can rival her in the
number, the scale, and the magnificence of the
shrines which she reared to her innumerable
gods. The claim of the Greek to be the supreme
temple-builder of the ancient world is, of course,
unquestioned, and nothing in Egypt can bear
comparison with the serene beauty of the
Parthenon; but, though the Egyptian architect
knew nothing of that exquisite balance and
harmony of proportion which has made Greek
architecture the crown of human effort in sacred
building, the temples of Egypt have a grandeur
and impressiveness of their own which make a profound
appeal to the mind; and the contribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of the Egyptian to the sum of human achievement
in this respect is coming to be more and
more appreciated every day.</p>

<p>The pyramids show him to have been one of
the great master-builders of the world in respect
of the vastness of his creations; the temples,
often scarcely less impressive in this respect,
show him to have been also a master in the art
of constructing stately and nobly proportioned
examples of that art of the column and architrave
of which the temples of Hellas gave the supreme
demonstration. The question of how much the
Greek owed to the earlier builder may still be
the subject of debate; but there can be no
question of the originality of the architects who
gave to the world such noble specimens of the
builder’s art as the great colonnades of Karnak
and Luxor, the beautiful terraces of Der el-Bahri,
and the later glories of Edfu and Philæ.</p>

<p>In one sense there can be comparatively little
to tell in the way of a story of excavation with
regard to the Egyptian temples. In Mesopotamia
and Babylonia the remains of the great temples
of Anu and Adad, of Enlil, and of Marduk, owe
their restoration to the light of day entirely to
the spade of the excavator, for they were
completely buried beneath the dust of ages in
the great mounds of Ashur, Nippur, and Babylon,
and almost nothing was visible to tell of their
former splendours till the modern excavator
patiently stripped away the mantle in which time
had wrapped them.</p>

<p>But the temples of Egypt had never
experienced the oblivion which had covered their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
northern rivals. They had suffered, indeed,
many things at the hands of Time and of human
vandalism. Sometimes they were half-buried in
the sand which had risen higher and higher,
century after century, around their columns;
sometimes the shrines of a rival faith had been
thrust incongruously into their ruined courts, or
an Arab village had grown up like an ugly
parasite on their roofs; but there always remained
enough to tell that the work of one of the great
master-building races of the world was there,
waiting the time when it should be stripped of
these paltry accretions, and revealed in its full
beauty. Karnak, Luxor, Edfu, Dendera, and
their companion shrines were never quite forgotten,
and even Hatshepsut’s exquisite terraces
at Der el-Bahri, half-smothered beneath the sand,
and wrecked by Coptic fanaticism though they
were, still showed enough to enable the
first European explorers who described them
(MM. Jollois and Devilliers of Napoleon’s
Expedition of 1798) to be sure of the general
character of the building which lay beneath the
rubbish-heaps.</p>

<p>Accordingly the work of the excavator in
connection with the temples of Egypt has not
been so much the discovery of the unknown as
the recovery of the complete form of what was
already partially known, the clearing away of the
excrescences which had attached themselves in
the course of centuries to the original structures;
the preservation of the more delicate work, such
as relief-sculpture and painting, from further
injury; the re-establishment in a state of security<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
of tottering walls and columns; and, not least,
the tracing out of the history of the building of
temples which were in general the work of
centuries, and of many kings. It has all been
work which, from its very nature, can have but
little of the nature of romance about it, which has
but seldom led to any startling finds, which has
involved a colossal amount of sheer hard labour,
without any very conspicuous rewards; but
which has resulted in the temples becoming
intelligible to the ordinary traveller, and safe for
his interest for generations to come, and has
enabled us to trace, in the case of a great structure
like Karnak, the successive stages by which the
vast building grew to a finished whole.</p>

<p>It is, of course, obviously impossible to
attempt to tell, even in the scantiest outline,
the story of a work which has extended over the
whole length of the land from the Delta to the
furthest bounds of Egyptian influence in Nubia,
and has been carried on by scores of workers
of all nationalities. Perhaps our end will best
be served by taking a typical instance of the
recovery of a temple, and telling in more or less
detail the story of the work which gave it back
to present-day knowledge. We take as our
example Queen Hatshepsut’s terraced temple at
Der el-Bahri, one of the most beautiful, as it is
now also one of the most famous, of Egyptian
buildings.</p>

<p>In all Egypt there is probably no more
beautiful or imposing site than that of the
“Paradise of Amen,” which the great queen
reared to the glory of the Theban god and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
her own name. On the western side of the Nile,
almost exactly opposite Karnak, the limestone
cliffs of the Libyan Range sweep backwards in a
great semicircle, forming a bay across whose
mouth is drawn the long line of the funerary
temples of the Theban kings of the XVIIIth
and XIXth Dynasties. Behind them, and behind
the innumerable tombs of Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh
and the Northern Assassif, there lies, close against
the salmon-red cliffs, the building which, of all
Egyptian temples, makes the strongest appeal
of pure beauty, as distinguished from the
impressiveness which comes from sheer scale
and mass.</p>

<figure id="il_9" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 41em;">
  <img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="1946" height="1341" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">9. HATSHEPSUT’S TEMPLE, DER EL-BAHRI, GENERAL VIEW.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The site is one which offers peculiar
advantages, but is also encompassed with peculiar
risks. No more magnificent background for a
building could be desired; but the background
is precisely of such magnificence as to form a
dangerous pitfall in which a merely mediocre
architect would have been lost. To attempt to
compete with Nature, when the work of man has
to be placed in such close proximity with her
towering architecture, would be to ensure hopeless
defeat and to invite ridicule. Khufu’s mountain
of stone gets its full value from contrast with the
long lines of the desert plateau on whose edge it
stands. The columns and obelisks of Karnak
and Luxor are far enough from the hills on either
bank of the Nile to make the human handiwork
the central and impressive feature of the picture;
but the site at Der el-Bahri would have made
what was possible elsewhere a mere derision.
To have placed the huge columns which seem so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
great on the Theban plain in competition with
the soaring vertical lines of the Libyan cliffs
would have been to place a fool’s cap on the most
grandiose work of human hands. What was
needed at Der el-Bahri was a building which
should avoid the very idea of rivalry with Nature’s
handiwork, and which should conquer by subjection,
a building where all the emphasis should
be laid on the horizontal lines of structure, so as
to disclaim at once the thought of competition
with the towering buttresses and bastions behind.</p>

<p>It may be questioned if ever an architect more
thoroughly appreciated the conditions of his
problem, or more satisfactorily fulfilled them,
than did Senmut, when he designed for Queen
Hatshepsut the three rising courts of the Paradise
of Amen, with the long slopes leading from the
one to the other, and the stately colonnades,
where the shadows are so cunningly pressed into
the decorative scheme, and the vertical lines of
the columns give emphasis to the horizontality
of the whole conception, and never for one
moment suggest rivalry with the cliffs above.</p>

<p>Excavation, which has done so much for our
knowledge of Der el-Bahri, has taught us that the
originality of the XVIIIth Dynasty architect was
not quite so absolute as was once imagined, and
that he owed at least the idea of colonnaded
terraces to the great man of the XIth Dynasty,
Mertisen or another, who designed the pyramid-temple,
“Glorious are the seats of King
Mentuhotep Neb-hepet-Ra,” for his royal master.
But Senmut was one of those great men who,
though they take their blessings where they find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
them, can never be accused of plagiarism, because
they give back to the world the original idea
transfigured and glorified. He has made the idea
of the terraced courts and colonnades his own,
while avoiding the heavy central block, which,
with its somewhat paltry pyramid (if this was
ever completed), must have been a contradiction
to the whole conception of the rest of the building;
and his spacious courts, with their almost Greek
grace of surrounding colonnade, seem touched
with a spirit which is lacking in the older work.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hichens has told us how “after
the terrific masculinity of Medinet-Abu, after
the great freedom of the Ramesseum, and the
grandeur of its colossus, the temple at Deir-el-Bahari
came upon him like a delicate woman,
perfumed and arranged, clothed in a creation of
white and blue and orange, standing—ever so
knowingly—against a background of orange and
pink, of red and of brown-red, a smiling coquette
of the mountain”; and though his idea is quite
too fantastically elaborated (for the idea of
conscious striving after prettiness is the last
thing one could think of in connection with
Der el-Bahri), yet the idea of femininity does occur
to the mind when the temple is compared with
other Egyptian work. Hatshepsut had not much
of the weak woman about her, to all appearance,
and Senmut, if his statues are any clue to the man,
was as rough-hewn and masculine a piece of
granite as one might encounter; but between
them they managed to rear a temple which
stands alone in Egypt for the feminine quality
of grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>So now we may turn to the story of how this
most graceful of Egyptian temples, unique in
its grace if not in its main idea, and unique also
in that it is the only temple in Egypt which came
into being wholly at the bidding of a woman, was
rescued from the accumulations of two and a
half millenniums of neglect and the ravages of
religious fanaticism.</p>

<p>Hatshepsut’s temple was first made known
to the modern world, as we have seen, by
MM. Jollois and Devilliers, two of the savants
attached to Napoleon’s Expedition of 1798. The
English traveller Pococke had indeed visited the
site in 1737; but the thing which chiefly interested
him was the abundance of mummies, and all
that can be learned about the temple from his
mention of it is that in his day the sanctuary was
apparently accessible. “Here it seemed,” he
says, “as though the mountain had been vertically
hewn out by the hand of man, and the people of
the place said that there had once been a passage
through it into the next valley”—the Valley of
the Kings.</p>

<p>What the French explorers saw sixty years
later was not a great deal more. They traced
what they believed to be the bases of a series of
sphinxes which had formerly formed an avenue,
42 feet wide and 437 yards long, leading up to
the enclosure-wall of the temple, the remains of
a wall which must have formed part of one of the
terraces, what they took for the evidence of two
flights of steps, leading to the higher levels of
the building, the central part of the highest
platform, and the rock-cut sanctuary which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Pococke had seen. The rest of the temple was
completely covered with heaps of sand and
rubbish.</p>

<p>The next visitor of importance was the famous
Champollion, who, as was natural in the first
decipherer of the hieroglyphics, was chiefly
interested in the inscriptions which were visible,
especially on the granite trilithon portal of the
upper platform; and the great scholar at once
recognised the existence in these of a puzzle
which was only to be solved later. He read the
cartouche of Hatshepsut as that of a king
Amenenthe; but was surprised to see that all
the nouns and verbs referring to this unknown
king were in the feminine, and that the royal
builder was addressed by Amen-Ra as “His
daughter whom he loves.” He imagined the
existence of a female ruler Amense, who must
have been connected by marriage with an
unknown Thothmes, and also with the unknown
Amenenthe, and his solution of the mystery,
though his names were incorrect, was, after all,
not so far from the truth.</p>

<p>Champollion found evidence in the work of
the temple of one of his favourite theories—that
Greek art found its origin in imitation of Egyptian
work; and here, again, he was only anticipating
the recognition of the fact that the colonnades
of Der el-Bahri approach nearer to the style of
Greek work than almost any other work in Egypt.</p>

<figure id="il_10" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 43em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">10. NORTH COLONNADE, DER EL-BAHRI; “PROTO-DORIC” COLUMNS.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Nearly thirty years after the first French
explorers, and shortly after the visit of
Champollion, Wilkinson surveyed the ruins, and
apparently saw, not only the ramps of approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
to the courts, but also one of the pillared corridors
whose walls were covered with sculptures of
soldiers carrying boughs and weapons, and with a
scene representing the dedication of two obelisks
to Amen. His reading of the name of the builder
of the temple, Amunneitgori, or Amun-noohet,
was no nearer to the truth than that of
Champollion, though he saw that the French
scholar’s unknown Thothmes was no other than
Thothmes II.</p>

<p>Lepsius, who evidently saw more of the temple
than any of his predecessors, was the first to make
a real approach to the true reading of its builder’s
name. His version of the name, “Numt Amen,”
was indeed an almost correct reading of part of
Hatshepsut’s title, Khnum Amen; and he conjectured
that she was the eldest sister of
Thothmes III, who occupied the throne during
the minority of her brother, but was not permitted
to rank in the regular lists of the kings of Egypt.</p>

<p>In 1858 the indefatigable Mariette visited the
temple, and added it to the thirty-six other sites
at which he carried on excavations during his
thirty years of ceaseless toil. He was too busy
with other work at Qurneh to give to Der el-Bahri
the attention which it deserved, and his work
there was carried on only with a small staff, and
for a short time, though he worked again at the
place in 1862 and 1866. Nor were his methods
here such as to be helpful to his successors.
Working, as he did all his lifetime, under the
lash, as it were, and with the need of getting
the largest possible results with the smallest
expenditure of money and time, it was impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
for him to make his clearances thorough and
methodical. Indeed, he seriously added to the
difficulties of subsequent excavators by the fact
that instead of removing the rubbish of his
excavations completely outside the probable
limits of the temple, he was forced by stress of
time and want of money simply to dump his
waste on the nearest convenient spot within the
temple area. The consequence was that when
Naville came to make the systematic clearance
of the whole building, he found several of the
most important chambers completely buried,
not only beneath the debris of the centuries, but
beneath that also which Mariette had heaped on
the top of everything.</p>

<p>All the same, it was Mariette who, as in so
many other instances, first revealed to the world
the real wonder of Der el-Bahri and the surpassing
interest of its sculptured halls. His was
the first plan to give us anything like a true
conception of the form of the temple, then held
to be unique in Egyptian architecture; and
though his restoration of the details, or rather
the restoration of M. Brune, working on his
material, was incorrect in several points, it was a
good deal less so than some more pretentious
attempts which succeeded it, and at least gave an
impression intelligible, and in the main not very
far from the actuality.</p>

<p>It was to this first excavation of Mariette
also that we owe what has ever since been the
most picturesque, and not the least informing,
of the treasures of Der el-Bahri—the wonderful
series of reliefs representing the voyage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Hatshepsut’s squadron to Punt, which decorates
the retaining wall terminating the middle platform
of the temple. This series of sculptures, one of
the priceless treasures of New Empire Egyptian
art, would of itself be the justification of Mariette’s
work.</p>

<p>In 1893 the Egypt Exploration Fund took
up the great task of completely excavating Queen
Hatshepsut’s temple, and their work, conducted
by M. Edouard Naville and a number of
assistants, only closed with the publication, in
1908, of the sixth folio volume of plates and
plans, completing, with the introductory memoir,
a present-day memorial which even the great
queen need not have disdained, and which is
worthy of her fine achievement. By the patient
efforts of M. Naville and his fellow-workers the
long ramps and spacious courts of the temple
were completely cleared of the rubbish of
centuries, their graceful colonnades put in a
condition of safety, and the priceless coloured
reliefs roofed over so as to protect them from the
ruinous effects of the weather, which, even in
the period between the work of Mariette and that
of the Egypt Exploration Fund, had wrought
more damage to the wonderful series of scenes
of the Expedition to Punt than had been done
by all the centuries of neglect.</p>

<p>Wisely the explorers made no attempt at
restoration. Their aim was solely one of preservation,
and we owe to them the fact that the most
interesting temple of the XVIIIth Dynasty is
now in a condition which permits some realisation
of its former beauty, and which promises its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
endurance for centuries to come. Thanks to
the explorers’ labours, and to the complete view
of the building which we owe to Mr. Somers
Clarke, the memorial temple of Egypt’s greatest
queen is now as well known in all its essential
features as almost any structure in the world.</p>

<p>The work at Der el-Bahri, however, only
ended in one aspect to begin in another. Already
in 1879 Mariette, to whose instinct for the
possibilities of the various Egyptian sites full
justice has never been done, had declared his
belief, founded on his discovery of a block of
stone bearing the name of King Mentuhotep
Neb-hepet-Ra of the XIth Dynasty, and of
several fragments of columns, that a small temple
of the XIth Dynasty had once existed not far
from Hatshepsut’s great temple. In 1903, after
the completion of the actual work of excavation
at the great temple, M. Naville began the excavation
of the large mounds to the south of the site
of his former labours, and with the assistance of
Dr. H.&nbsp;R. Hall and others, the work was carried
on till 1907, the final volume of results being
published in 1913.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">11. RELIEFS, DER EL-BAHRI.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The work began, as M. Naville tells us,
chiefly with the view of clearing the XIth Dynasty
cemetery which the explorer was convinced lay
beneath the great mounds of rubbish; but the
cemetery soon proved to be less, and other
objects more, important than had been anticipated.
Ere long the diggers made out the line
of a ramp, running parallel to the outer wall of
Hatshepsut’s temple, and, following up the
traces of building which successively revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
themselves, as the mounds, often from 15 to
20 feet in height, were cleared away, they at last
completely unearthed the remains of a building
which is as unique in the history of Egyptian
architecture as Hatshepsut’s temple was formerly
thought to be. The temple was at an early stage
found to belong, as Mariette had suggested, to
the XIth Dynasty, and to be the work of one of
the greatest kings of this little-known line of
rulers, the Mentuhotep Neb-hepet-Ra who has
already been mentioned.</p>

<p>It is by no means in such good preservation
as its great companion, for about the end of the
XIXth Dynasty it appears to have been definitely
abandoned as a temple, and handed over to the
tender mercies of the masons who used it as a
convenient quarry for material. Nothing is now
standing above 10 feet from the pavement level,
and none of the pillars are above 7 feet in
height. Yet the remains are sufficiently complete
to allow of the understanding of the appearance
which the whole must have presented in the days
when Hatshepsut’s architect took its platform
and colonnades as the inspiration of the great
work on which he was engaged at its side.</p>

<p>At the end of a spacious enclosure, bounded
by a double temenos wall of which the outer
member was of brick and the inner of limestone,
a broad ramp, sloping somewhat steeply, rose to
the level of a rectangular platform. The retaining
wall of the platform was faced, as in the later
temple, with a colonnade consisting of a double
row of pillars square on plan. The platform
itself was surrounded by a double range of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
similar square pillars, which was roofed over,
and made a kind of veranda completely enclosing
the central mass of the temple. In the centre of
this colonnade, a door, curiously narrow and
paltry for so fine a building (it is only 3 feet wide),
gave access to an almost square hypostyle hall,
whose roof was supported by a perfect forest of
octagonal columns ranged on three sides in three
rows, and on the fourth, at the back of the hall,
in two. In the centre of this hall, and probably
with a narrow open space between it and the
innermost row of columns, rose the unique
feature of the temple—a rectangular mass of
rubble faced with hewn stone, and surmounted
by a pyramid of similar materials. Behind the
pyramid, and against the wall which separated
the pyramid-court from the rear portion of the
temple, were several shrines, corresponding to
certain tombs in the court beyond.</p>

<p>Passing through another granite doorway, of
the same meagre proportions as the one in the
front of the hall, the visitor entered an open
court surrounded by a colonnade of octagonal
columns, two deep on the southern side, but
single on the east and west. In the midst of
this court the mouth of a sloping passage, which
descended for 150 metres to the rock-hewn
sanctuary, lined with granite and furnished with
an alabaster shrine, where the <em>Ka</em> of King
Mentuhotep was worshipped, formed a strange
and impressive feature. Beyond the open court
stood another hypostyle hall, with eight rows of
octagonal columns, ten deep, and, last of all, a
passage, bounded by two walls which reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
from the seventh of the two central rows of
columns in the hall, led to a tiny sanctuary hewn
out of the cliff behind the temple.</p>

<p>Such was the temple of Mentuhotep as
excavation has revealed it to us—undoubtedly a
most interesting memorial of Middle Kingdom
architecture, and most important as being by far
the most complete example which has survived
of the work of that period. Probably we should
have thought the dominant feature of the building,
the central pyramid, rather an incongruity than
otherwise, and evidently Senmut, when he came
to his great task six hundred years later, thought
so too, for he adopted the ideas of his predecessor
in other respects, but discarded what
seems to us the clumsy pyramid block altogether.
One thing, however, Senmut could not do. He
could not secure for his splendid design anything
like the fineness of masonry which Mentuhotep’s
architect had been able to compass in the older
temple. The XVIIIth Dynasty builders, clever
though they were in many respects, left poor
work behind them compared with the magnificent
masonry of the XIth Dynasty men.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of the
older building was found in the six shrines which
have been already mentioned. They belonged
to certain princesses, Aashait, Sadhe, Kauit,
Kemsit, and Henhenit, with one unnamed, who
were also priestesses. These shrines were in
connection with the tombs of the ladies in
question, who were buried within the temple.</p>

<p>The building had been completed before
either the tombs or the shrines were inserted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
and the inference has been drawn that these were
the ladies of the harem who were chosen for the
honour of accompanying King Mentuhotep on
his voyage through the Underworld to the regions
of the blessed—in other words, who were killed
at his funeral so that he should not lack company
in the world of the dead. The survival to so late
a period of this barbarous custom is not proved,
though it has been suggested that it continued
even as late as the middle of the XVIIIth Dynasty;
but at all events the shrines of the princesses
have furnished us with some fine examples of the
work of the little-known XIth Dynasty.</p>

<p>In the extreme north corner of the temple,
Thothmes III intruded another shrine to the
goddess Hathor, which was discovered during
the progress of the excavations in February, 1906,
and has provided us with one of the most admirable
examples extant of Egyptian sculpture. The
shrine is a small chamber, 10 feet long and 8 feet
high, hewn in the rock and lined with sandstone.
The slabs are sculptured with religious scenes
in which Thothmes III makes offerings to Hathor.
The goddess herself stood in the centre of the
shrine in the shape of a life-sized figure of a
cow, suckling a kneeling figure of a king, while
another royal figure stands in front under her
head. The name of Amenhotep II is attached to
these figures; but the probability is that they
were meant to represent Thothmes III, who
dedicated the chapel, and that all that
Amenhotep II had to do with the act of piety
was the engraving of his cartouche on his father’s
work. The Hathor cow of Der el-Bahri is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
quite one of the masterpieces of New Empire
art, quite eclipsing the famous example of the
same figure which has come from the Saite
period and has hitherto been esteemed one of the
finest specimens of Egyptian animal sculpture.
“Neither Greece nor Rome,” says Maspero of
the Der el-Bahri cow, “has left us anything that
can be compared with it; we must go to the great
sculptors of animals of our own day to find an
equally realistic piece of work.” Indeed the
Hathor cow and the two lions of Amenhotep III
and Tutankhamen, now in the British Museum,
might be safely taken as the pieces on which
Egyptian sculpture might elect to stand as an
interpreter of animal figure.</p>

<p>Such, then, have been the main results of
excavation on a single Egyptian site; surely
enough to afford ample justification of the
expenditure of time and money and labour which
has been involved. Two great temples have
been given back to the knowledge of the world—one
of them, it is true, from a period otherwise
fairly well known, the other from a period which
was hitherto almost a blank. Even in the case
of the later temple, where the results contained
no surprises, and only extended our already
existing knowledge, the contribution of this site
to our estimate of Egyptian art was of surpassing
value; while Mentuhotep’s temple has filled a
gap at one of the points where further knowledge
of Egyptian history and art was most to be
desired.</p>

<p>There have been no marvels of buried treasure
to gild the pages of the story of excavation at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Der el-Bahri; but there has been a solid addition
to the sum of human knowledge of the past.
At a score of other sites, work similar to that which
has just been described has been continually
going on during the last thirty years. Mariette’s
beginnings of clearance at sites such as Edfu,
Esneh, Denderah, and Abydos have been followed
by work whose thoroughness has been such as
Mariette, from the nature of the case, could never
have accomplished. To tell the story of excavation,
even in the most meagre outline, would take
a volume instead of a chapter, and Der el-Bahri
must suffice as a typical example of the kind of
work which has been done all up and down the
land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Reference must be made, however, to one
piece of work, associated, curiously enough, also
with the name of the explorer of Der el-Bahri,
which has a unique interest of its own. This is
the discovery of the Pool of Osiris, which, as
Strabo told us, lay beneath the great temple,
or, as he called it, the Memnonium, at Abydos.
In 1914 M. Naville, following up the work of
Miss M.&nbsp;A. Murray and Professor Petrie in
1902–3, found a great underground chamber,
100 feet by 60 feet, constructed of huge blocks
of limestone, cased inside with hard red sandstone.
The pillars, the architraves, and the
roofing-blocks of the aisles of this chamber were
all of fine granite, without adornment or inscription,
and in fact resembled almost exactly the
similar work in the so-called “Temple of the
Sphinx” at Gizeh, with this difference, that
whereas the granite pillars of the Temple of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
Sphinx are 3 feet square, those of the chamber
at Abydos are 8½ feet square. The wonder of
the building, however, was its arrangement. In
the centre of the chamber stood two rows of
these great granite monoliths, each row consisting
of five pillars. Around the central block of
masonry on which these pillars rested, ran a deep
channel, which had manifestly once been filled
with water, so as to render the central block an
island.</p>

<p>Around this channel runs a ledge of stonework
about 3 feet wide, and from this ledge access
is given to a set of seventeen cells each about
6 feet square and 6 feet high.</p>

<p>Manifestly this extraordinary building is
Strabo’s “well,” which, as he tells us, was below
the temple, and was built like the Labyrinth,
only on a smaller scale, with passages covered
by a single stone. What may have been its use
it is as yet impossible to say. The water channel
and the ledge round it suggest that the boat of
Osiris may have been towed around the pool
by his priests on the great feast-days, or when
the Passion Play of Abydos, representing the
death and resurrection of Osiris, was being
celebrated. Two things alone seem certain, the
first, the identity of the chamber with the pool
described by the old geographer, and the second,
that we have here one of the most ancient sacred
buildings in Egypt.</p>

<p>Other parts of the structure are the work of
the XIXth Dynasty, which did so much at
Abydos, and bear the cartouche of Merenptah
and representations of this king worshipping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
gods; but the chamber of the pool is another
matter. Its construction is of such a character
as to refer it at once to a very much earlier date;
and there can be little doubt that the resemblance
to the Temple of the Sphinx is only the evidence
of the fact that the two buildings are of the same
period, and that the Pool of Osiris is the earliest
Egyptian building of any size known, apart from
the pyramids.</p>

<p>The magnificence of its masonry shows how
far the Egyptians of this early period had already
carried the system of construction which they
were to use to such splendid purpose in the great
temples of the land. Never again, however,
even in the great days of New Empire building,
did they put together such a piece of sumptuous
massiveness as the underground chamber of
Osiris at Abydos.</p>

<p>Another aspect of work among the temples
must be referred to, as being, in its own way, not
less important than the rescuing of the actual
structures from obscurity and neglect; and that
is the interpretation of the work thus rescued,
the tracing of its history, and the disentangling
of the various periods of building which are
represented, and the different hands which have
been at work in the completion of a building
whose history as a growing organism may stretch
through centuries, and involve the activities of
half a dozen dynasties.</p>

<p>To make the temples intelligible is a matter
scarcely less important than to make them
visible, and it has involved scarcely less effort.
Even after all that has been accomplished in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
this direction, a great Egyptian temple such as
Karnak remains a sufficiently complicated
business to bewilder the ordinary sight-seer and
make him turn with relief to the clarity of
Greek architecture; but at least it is now
possible to arrive at something like an understanding
of how the vast bulk of Karnak grew,
century after century, to what we now see, and
to realise a little of the romance of history which
is involved in the succession of Pharaohs who
have laboured to make great and splendid the
holy and beautiful house of Amen in Thebes.</p>

<p>Let us turn, then, to Karnak, and try to see
a little of what modern work has done in the
direction of making this vastest of extant Egyptian
temples intelligible. A century ago, Belzoni
wandered round the ruins of the great temple,
his mind filled with vague dreams of Memnon,
Osymandias, and Psammethes, perhaps as
appreciative of the wonder of what he saw as
the most enlightened of his successors, but
absolutely in the dark as to the significance of
what he saw, or the history of how the great
building had been reared; to-day the story
of Karnak is practically as well understood as
that of one of our European cathedrals, and
anyone who likes to take the trouble may trace
out the evidence of its age-long growth. Indeed
it is difficult for the modern to realise how
lengthy is the story which unfolds itself in the
sculptured stones of the great temple. We think
with something like awe of the long process
which reared some of our cathedrals, and which
may, perhaps, have lasted for a century, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
perhaps, in an extreme case, for two; but Karnak
was a growing organism for a period of time more
than twice as long, not only as any of our cathedrals
took in the building, but twice as long as
any of them have been standing. Towards the
eastern end of the vast complex of Karnak there
are still to be seen the scanty relics of the earliest
builders of the temple of whom we have any
knowledge—the Middle Kingdom Pharaohs, who
began their work at Karnak certainly not much
later than 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> On the western face of the
great temple is the Pylon of the Ptolemies, whose
dynasty only closed with the subjection of Egypt
to Roman rule in 30 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Karnak, in other words,
was building for a period which was certainly
not less than seventeen hundred years, and which
may have been almost two thousand! Such a
consideration makes our ideas as to duration
seem very small indeed.</p>

<p>Nor has the work been less complicated than
it has been lengthy. Practically every Pharaoh
worth naming has left his mark on the great
building in some form or another, and often
the work of the reigning king was done without
the slightest regard to that of his forerunners;
sometimes, indeed, with the deliberate design
of obscuring it and blotting out its memory.
Consequently the task of disentangling the story
of Karnak has been no easy one. It has been
like the reading of a manuscript where interpolations
of different writers, dealing with different
matters, continually break the thread of the main
narrative, and where, to add to the confusion,
part of the writing is a palimpsest, written over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the faded script of an earlier author. Along with
the difficulty of interpreting the story of the
various buildings has gone that of preserving
them from destruction.</p>

<p>One of the curious facts about Egyptian
building is that, for a race of master-builders
such as they showed themselves to be, they were
strangely, even culpably careless about their
foundations. If the mighty halls which they
reared had been built on such foundations as
modern builders would insist on for even much
less important structures, there seems no reason
why, short of deliberate destruction by the hand
of man, the Egyptian temples should not stand
practically for ever. But the Egyptian architect
was content to pile walls and colonnades which are
the wonder of the world on the most flimsy
foundations, and his work is in most cases literally
a house built on the sand.</p>

<p>The wonder is, not that there have been
occasional collapses, but that the buildings have
stood so long as they have; indeed nothing but
their sheer mass and weight has enabled them to
endure. Even so, earth-tremors, and the constant
and insidious work of infiltration, have worked
havoc on the badly founded buildings, and were
it not for the constant care devoted to them,
and the work of practically refounding them
which has been carried out, the great halls of
Karnak would ere long be only masses of tumbled
ruin. There is nothing dramatic about the work
of either the interpreter or the preserver; neither
can point, in general, to any treasure-trove which
has resulted from his efforts, though occasionally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
as notably in connection with the work of
M. Legrain at Karnak, the work of preservation
has resulted in the unearthing of a mass of the
most wonderful ancient statuary. But we owe
the double fact that Karnak stands to-day and
is likely to stand for centuries to come, and that
its vast complex of building is intelligible, to
many years of quiet and unobtrusive work on
the part of scholars and architects.</p>

<p>In the great days of Egypt’s glory under the
New Empire, Thebes must have been one of
the wonder-cities of the world, and one of the
fairest sights on which the sun ever shone. It
may be that Babylon, in the short-lived glory of
the Neo-Babylonian Empire of Nebuchadnezzar,
was vaster in extent, and the German excavations
have taught us how gorgeous were some of the
great buildings of the city, with their facings of
enamelled brick and their wealth of colour;
but it may be questioned if even Babylon could
show anything to match the solemn splendour
of Karnak or Luxor, and beside the ordered
sumptuousness of the huge Egyptian temples,
with their wonders of megalithic construction, one
imagines that Babylon’s glories would have seemed
rather cheap and tawdry. And of all the glories
of Thebes, Karnak was the centre and crown.</p>

<p>Petrie tells us that the pitiful remains of the
Labyrinth, the great temple of Amenemhat III
of the XIIth Dynasty, show that it was big
enough to hold all the temples of Karnak and
Luxor put together; but the imagination is
scarcely capable of trying to comprehend the
extent of such a building, and Karnak is quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
big enough for most people. The actual area
of its buildings is about equal to that of St. Peter’s
(Rome), Milan, and Nôtre Dame (Paris); while
the sacred enclosure, the Cathedral Close, so to
speak, would hold another half-dozen of the
biggest cathedrals of Europe, without crowding
them unduly.</p>

<p>Let us try to imagine ourselves visiting the
great temple in the days when it had reached its
greatest extent, though, by that time, the glory
of Thebes had in great measure departed. Still
the building, as we now see it, was practically
completed only in the days of the Ptolemies, and
no survey of it would be adequate without
including their work. Unfortunately in taking
the temple in the natural order of approach, by
its west front, so to speak, we reverse almost
exactly the order of its building, which was,
generally speaking, from east to west. Yet the
history of the building is sufficiently intelligible
even when thus taken in reverse order, and
though there are other approaches to Karnak,
and the approach by either the Eastern or the
Western Avenue of Sphinxes must have been very
impressive, yet the main front of the temple must
always have been that which faced the Nile, in
the termination of the axis of the whole structure.
No doubt also the Egyptian Kings, with their
fondness for using their great river as the scene
of ceremonial processions, used the western front
of the temple for their visits to the shrine of
Amen.</p>

<p>We land, then, at a quay of hewn stone,
adorned with two small obelisks of Sety II of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
XIXth Dynasty, and with two statues of couchant
lions. Passing down a short and gentle slope,
we move along a broad paved way between rows
of couchant ram-headed sphinxes, which were
placed here by Ramses II. The path extends
for 200 feet, and leads up to the vastest portal to
be found even in this land of vast portals. This is
the First Pylon of Karnak—first in point of
approach, but last in point of erection, for it is
the work of the Ptolemaic Pharaohs who grasped
the sceptre of Egypt after the death of Alexander
the Great; and indeed, as you can see, the work
is not yet complete. Building is still going on,
and the ramps of crude brick by which the great
stones are dragged up to their positions are still
heaped against the walls, where they will continue
to stand for more than two thousand years.</p>

<p>The pylon itself is gigantic. The breadth
of the west front of St. Paul’s, the greatest
building familiar to English minds, is 179 feet,
and its height, to the top of the statue of St. Paul
on the pediment, is 135 feet. The Pylon of the
Ptolemies measures 370 feet in breadth, or rather
more than double St. Paul’s, while its height is
142½ feet, so that it overtops St. Paul’s head by
7½ feet. In addition its walls are 49 feet thick.
No mightier approach to a temple was ever
devised.</p>

<p>Passing through this great gateway we find
ourselves in an open court whose dimensions
are worthy of the portal which gave access to it.
From the gateway where you stand to the
scarcely less imposing pylon of Ramses I, which
faces you across the open space, this court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
measures 275 feet, while its breadth is 338 feet.
The area of St. Paul’s is 84,000 square feet, so
that this single court of Karnak exceeds our great
cathedral in area by 8000 square feet. Around
its walls runs a colonnade of single columns.
In the north corner of the court there stands a
little grey sandstone temple, divided into three
chapels, which are dedicated to Amen, Mut, and
Khonsu, the members of the Theban Triad.
The southern colonnade is broken by the intruding
front of a larger temple. This is the temple of
Ramses III, the last of the great warrior kings of
Egypt, who saved the land, in the degenerate
days of the XXth Dynasty, from being overrun
and ravaged by the raid of the Sea-Peoples. His
temple, though very modest in size (it measures
only 170 feet in length), is important as giving
one of the most perfect examples extant of a
complete Egyptian temple, built from start to
finish by one monarch, and on a straightforward
and homogeneous plan.</p>

<p>The great court which has taken these two
lesser buildings into its sweep was the work of
the Libyan Pharaohs of the XXIInd Dynasty,
who held their court at Bubastis, and is therefore
often called the Court of the Bubastites. The
temple of Ramses III was cleared of rubbish in
1896–7 by M. Legrain, in the course of his
great work at Karnak. Down the central avenue
of the Bubastite court the Ethiopian Pharaohs
of the XXVth Dynasty began the erection of
a colonnade whose purpose has not been quite
determined. As they left it, it consisted of a
double range of huge columns, five in each row.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Of the ten, only one solitary survivor now stands,
and is known as the Column of Taharqa, after
the Ethiopian king who was responsible for its
erection, and for some of the sorest disasters of
Egypt in her declining days. It was Taharqa
and his successor Tanutamen who brought down
upon Egypt the wrath of the Assyrian conqueror,
Ashurbanipal, whose ruthless soldiery by the
sack of Thebes dealt the imperial city a blow from
which she never recovered. Taharqa’s column
stands as the memorial of a man who “began to
build, and was not able to finish” in more senses
than one.</p>

<p>Leaving the court for a moment by the portal
in the south-east corner, we find on the wall of
the second pylon one of the most interesting
records of the temple. This is the inscription
in which Sheshanq, one of the Libyan Pharaohs,
records the triumph of that campaign in Syria
in the course of which he humbled the pride of
Rehoboam of Judah, and robbed Solomon’s
temple of all the riches which the wise king had
accumulated. In Sheshanq’s relief a gigantic
figure of Amen leads up before the now vanished
figure of the king five rows of captive towns of
Palestine, each represented by a circular wall
enclosing its name, from which emerges the upper
part of a bound prisoner.</p>

<p>Before us, as we return to the great court,
rises the second pylon, the work of Ramses I,
the founder of the XIXth Dynasty. Scarcely
any part of the temple is more eloquent of the
jumble of times, and kings, and even faiths,
which goes to make up Karnak, than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
neighbourhood of this pylon. The great gateway
itself is of Ramses I; but its materials had their
own story before he built them into his new
approach to the temple of Amen, and had served
another god; for some of the blocks of the pylon
once belonged to one of the heretical temples of
Akhenaten, and bear his name and those of his
successors, Tutankhamen and Ay. The little
vestibule before the pylon is flanked by statues
of Ramses II; but within the doorway are found
the cartouches of Ramses I and Sety II, as well
as that of Ramses II, while part of the vestibule
is the work of two of the Ptolemies. Thus in
this little space the work of no fewer than eight
Pharaohs, covering a period of more than a
thousand years, is represented.</p>

<p>The gateway of Ramses I gives access to what
is perhaps the most remarkable, though by no
means the most beautiful, of the halls of Karnak.
The Hypostyle Hall, one of the hugest of human
creations, was, like so much else at Karnak, the
work of several sovereigns, though in this case the
completion of the building was not so very long
protracted as in some other instances. The hall
was begun by Ramses I, whose short reign of
two years only enabled him to see the work
started. The greater part of the hall as we now
see it is the work of Sety I, one of the finest of
Egyptian Pharaohs, whose work everywhere is
in accordance with the nobility of his face as it
can be seen at Cairo.</p>

<p>Sety carried out the erection of what is by
far the most imposing feature of the hall, the
nave, with its double row of gigantic open-flower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
columns, the largest in existence. Each of the
twelve tremendous columns is 69 feet in height
and 33 feet in circumference, while the spreading
capitals, 11 feet in height, have an area large
enough for one hundred men to stand upon.
Imagine twelve versions of the Trajan Column
at Rome, or the Vendôme Column at Paris, facing
one another in two rows and supporting gigantic
architraves of sixty to a hundred tons in weight,
which in their turn support the great roofing-slabs.
These form the central avenue of the great hall.
On either side of them the papyrus-bud columns
of the two side aisles rise to a height of 42½ feet.
The rows nearest to the central avenue on either
side bear above their architraves rectangular
pillars which make up the difference between the
height of the side columns and those of the
centre, and which bear the extremities of the roof
of the nave with its cornice. On the lower level
of the side pillars, the roof of the hall continues
over the rest of the area, supported by a forest
of one hundred and twenty-two columns.</p>

<p>Sety I is responsible for the whole of the
northern half of the hall, as well as for the central
avenue, so that the southern portion of the
building is all that Ramses II can claim as his
work, if indeed even this part was not erected
by his father, and only sculptured by him.
Ramses II, however, had the knack of securing
to himself the glory of work which was done by
other men, and to most people the great Hypostyle
Hall of Karnak is his work, though he had really
very little to do with it.</p>

<p>The architectural merits of the huge building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
are undoubted, up to a certain point; but its
faults are equally unquestionable. Mere size
tells here, as indeed it almost always does, unless
its impression is spoilt by sheer incapacity.
There can be no question of the impressiveness
of the great building. The central avenue, with
its soaring columns, and its grated clerestory
rising above the roofs of the side-aisles, is the
prototype of all subsequent cathedral architecture.
But the side-aisles do not add to the
dignity of the great chamber. Their forest of
squat, shapeless columns, instead of being impressive,
is only bewildering. Here, very certainly,
you cannot see the wood for the trees, and the
spaciousness of the hall is quite destroyed by the
multitude of the supports of its roof. “The size
that strikes us,” says Professor Petrie, “is not
the grandeur of strength, but the bulkiness of
disease.”</p>

<p>The outer walls of the great hall are sculptured
with reliefs representing the wars of its two
creators. The north wall bears a fine series of
scenes, covering over 200 feet of surface, in which
the wars of Sety I are depicted with great spirit.
In some later instances such war-reliefs are
merely wearisome; but these of Sety are both
vivacious and well-executed, and such scenes as
that of the king smiting the Libyans are among the
best examples of work in this kind, and infinitely
superior to the pretentious work of his son.
The southern wall has reliefs of Ramses II, his
eternal Battle of Kadesh, which he could never
forget, or allow anyone else to forget, a copy of
the treaty of peace with the Hittites, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
so-called Poem of Pentaur, in which the king’s
valour at Kadesh is celebrated.</p>

<p>Behind the Hypostyle Hall comes the
IIIrd Pylon, which was reared by the most
magnificent, if not the greatest, of Egyptian
Pharaohs, the gorgeous Amenhotep III, in whose
glittering reign the glories of the New Empire
seemed to culminate, before the shadows of his
son’s ill-starred attempt at religious reform
dimmed their splendour. When Thebes was
at the height of its fame, and when all the kings
of the ancient east were sending their ambassadors
to the great city to fall “seven times and
seven times” in the dust before the golden sandals
of the man who was God visible on earth to a
great part of the ancient world, this third pylon
was the main front of the great Theban temple,
which then occupied not much more than half
the space which it now covers. Its western face
was used by Sety as the back wall of the Hypostyle
Hall; but on the northern tower on the eastern
side can still be seen the faint remains of a great
scene in which a royal procession on the Nile in
honour of Amen is depicted. One great ship
over 40 feet long has the king standing on the
poop, and cabins with cornices amidships.
Thirty or forty rowers urge it along, and it
tows behind it the sacred barge of Amen, which
bears in a shrine a small processional bark of the
god, and at the bow a sphinx and an altar.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">14. KARNAK, COLUMNS OF THE SIDE-AISLE, HYPOSTYLE HALL.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Besides his pylon, Amenhotep wrought a vast
amount of work at Karnak; but it was not, like
that of Sety and Ramses, concentrated in a single
great structure, but dispersed in various parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
of the sacred enclosure, and so does not produce
the same effect. To see the work of Amenhotep
on a scale worthy of his importance in the line
of Egyptian Pharaohs, you have to go to Luxor
with its fine papyrus-bud forecourt, and its
noble nave, which, had it been finished, would
have almost rivalled the Hypostyle Hall of the
later kings in size and exceeded it in beauty;
or to try to think back the vanished glories of
what was probably the most gorgeous and
beautiful of all the Theban temples—the Funerary
temple of Amenhotep, which was destroyed, not
by the Assyrian conqueror, but by the royal
vandals of the XIXth Dynasty, Ramses II and his
son Merenptah.</p>

<p>All the same, Amenhotep accomplished no
small amount of work, in one way and another,
within the enclosure of Karnak. Just beyond
the girdle-wall of the great temple on the north
side, he built a temple to Mentu, the Theban
War-God, with a pylon, and obelisks of red
granite. This temple once contained statues in
black granite of the king, and of the goddess
Sekhmet, towards whom he evidently cherished
a feeling of deep devotion, if we may judge by
the number of statues to her which he dedicated
in the temple of Mut.</p>

<p>The temple of Mentu shared the usual fate of
Amenhotep’s work, and was meddled with by
Merenptah, Ramses V, and at least four of the
Ptolemies, a fair specimen of the fashion in which
the history of Karnak is complicated by the
multitude of superimposed strata, or rather of
interwoven strands, with which you have to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>On the south side, and just at the girdle-wall,
stands the beautiful temple of Khonsu (the son
of the Theban Triad), one of the finest examples
of a complete Egyptian temple of normal form.
This is not the work of Amenhotep, but of
Ramses III; but apparently an earlier temple of
Amenhotep must have once occupied the site,
for the king set up before the gateway a noble
avenue of one hundred and twenty-two sandstone
sphinxes bearing his name. Beyond the wall,
and approached by the eastern avenue of sphinxes,
lies another of Amenhotep’s contributions to
the glories of Karnak—the temple of Mut, the
mother-goddess of the Theban Triad, which
was excavated in 1895–7 by two English ladies,
Miss Margaret Benson and Miss Janet Gourlay.
It is full of Sekhmet statues, and behind it lies
a sacred lake, shaped like a horse-shoe.</p>

<p>But the following out of the work of
Amenhotep has drawn us away from our main
quest, the tracing of the story of Karnak proper.
Returning to the great temple by the eastern
avenue of sphinxes, we pass the girdle-wall by a
pylon built by Horemheb out of the material of
a temple which the unfortunate Akhenaten had
reared in Thebes to his new deity the Aten.
Beside the pylon stands a stele inscribed with a
manifesto of Horemheb, which was designed
to promote peace in the state after the religious
troubles of Akhenaten’s times. The square
court behind the pylon has on its east side the
ruins of a small temple of Amenhotep II, and the
walls of the court have reliefs of Horemheb.
Another pylon of Horemheb, in a very ruinous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
condition, closes the court on the north side, and
passing through it we are faced by one of the
most ancient parts of the whole building, the
pylon of Queen Hatshepsut. The pylon bears
witness both to what Professor Breasted calls
“the Feud of the Thutmosids,” and to the
religious strifes of the XVIIIth Dynasty, for
Hatshepsut’s name was erased from her reliefs
by Thothmes II, and all allusions to Amen were
scrupulously removed by Akhenaten, and restored
by Sety I. Behind Hatshepsut’s pylon we pass
a pylon of Thothmes III, her successor and
enemy, and traversing a court whose walls bear
inscriptions of Merenptah, the son and successor
of Ramses II, in which he describes his victories
over the Libyans and the Peoples of the Mediterranean,
we find ourselves back at the point from
which our digression started, in the central court
behind the great pylon of Amenhotep III. Here
was the western front of the temple in the days of
Thothmes I, and here still stands the solitary
remaining member of the quartette of obelisks
with which this king and Thothmes III adorned
the front of the pylon which now lies in ruins
behind them. The obelisks of the later king are
both gone—the survivor of the pair of Thothmes I
is a fine shaft, 75½ feet high.</p>

<p>Behind his pylon, and between it and a smaller
one which he erected to the east, Thothmes
reared a fine ceremonial hall with roof and columns
of cedar wood; but his work was not permitted
to endure for long. It was within this hall that
the priests of Amen arranged a little piece of
play-acting in which the god Amen declared his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
preference for Thothmes III as king, and it was
perhaps this unpalatable fact which determined
Queen Hatshepsut to make it the scene of a piece
of vandalism which was to redound to her own
glory. Anyhow, as the time for the celebration
of her jubilee drew near, she sent her architect,
Senmut, up to Aswan to bring down two great
shafts of granite for her jubilee obelisks, and when
the tremendous blocks, 97½ feet high, arrived,
she stripped off the roof from part of her father’s
hall and set them up there. Apart from the
filial piety of such an act, the obelisks were things
of which she might justly be proud.</p>

<p>With the single exception of the stone, the
work of her deadly enemy Thothmes III, which
now stands before St. John Lateran in Rome,
and which is 8 feet higher than its rival, the shaft
of Hatshepsut, which still remains erect at Karnak,
is the largest obelisk existing, and is more than
20 feet higher than the so-called “Cleopatra’s
Needle,” which represents to Londoners, as its
twin does to the folk of New York, the skill of
ancient Egypt.</p>

<figure id="il_15" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 41em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">15. KARNAK, VIEW FROM THE NORTH, OBELISKS OF HATSHEPSUT, AND THOTHMES I.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hatshepsut was so proud of her achievement
that she caused the shafts to be engraved with an
inscription in which she swears, “As Ra loves
me, as my father Amen favours me ... as I
shall be unto eternity like an Imperishable, as
I shall go down in the west like Atum, so surely
these two great obelisks which My Majesty
hath wrought with electrum for my father, Amen,
in order that my name may abide in his temple,
enduring for ever and ever, they are of one block
of enduring granite, without seam or joining.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
She goes on to say, what is still more surprising,
that the time occupied in the extraction and
transportation of the mighty shafts was seven
months!</p>

<p>When Thothmes III came to the throne, he
showed his love for his distinguished relative by
casing her obelisks to a height of 82 feet with
sandstone, so that her inscriptions might not be
read. As rulers, the Pharaohs of the XVIIIth
Dynasty, male or female, stand in the very front
rank; they cannot be said to have shone as
exponents of family affection.</p>

<p>To the east of his second pylon, Thothmes I
had another court, which was altered and added
to by Thothmes III, who built also a small
pylon in front of his Halls of Records, which
come next in the great complex of building,
jostling the apartments of Hatshepsut, which
stand beside them. In the First Hall of Records
stand the two pillars which strike everyone who
sees them as one of the beauties of Karnak, and
examples of a type not common in Egyptian work.
They are of granite, the southern one carved with
the Lotus of Upper Egypt, the northern with the
Papyrus of Lower Egypt. The Second Hall was
turned into the chapel of the temple, in which
the sacred bark was kept, by Philip Arrhidæus, at
the beginning of the Ptolemaic dominion, so that
one of the oldest and one of the newest parts of
the building are here united.</p>

<p>In the open space behind the chapel lie the
scanty remains of the earliest Karnak known to
us—that of the XIIth Dynasty. A few broken
polygonal columns suggest a kinship in style,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
for the earliest parts of the great temple, with the
work of the XIth Dynasty at Der el-Bahri; but
it is impossible to say with the least approach to
certainty what the first temple may have looked
like. East again of these remnants comes the
last important part of the vast building—the
great Festal Temple of Thothmes III, with its
fine Hall, 144 feet by 52 feet, and its eastern
sanctuary and complex of store-chambers.</p>

<p>The Festal Hall presents a feature unique
in Egyptian Architecture. Its colonnade consists
of thirty-two rectangular piers ranged round the
sides, while down the centre of the hall run two
rows of ten round columns, not spaced with the
piers, and of extraordinary shape. Instead of
tapering from the base to the top, their taper runs
the opposite way, and their capitals are inverted,
and present the appearance of a bell standing
on its mouth. The downwards tapering column
is, of course, a familiar feature in Minoan architectural
practice, and it is within the bounds
of possibility that Thothmes’ columns are an
Egyptian adaptation of a Minoan motive, for,
as the tombs of Senmut and Rekhmara show,
Minoan influence was at its height in the middle
of the XVIIIth Dynasty, and intercourse between
Crete and Egypt was frequent. Whether
Thothmes owed the idea to some Minoan
suggestion or not, it never established itself in
Egypt. In Crete, with its regular use of wooden
pillars resting on stone bases, the downward
taper was quite natural; in Egypt, with a
prevalent stone construction, it was an exotic,
and could show no reason for its existence, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
was never repeated. One cannot say that its
disappearance was any great loss to Egyptian
architecture, for the effect of the inversion is
singularly clumsy.</p>

<p>We have thus traced the story of Karnak as
one traverses the great temple from front to
rear, and the bewildering complexity of the
building is reflected in the variegated fabric of
the narrative. To call Karnak, as is often done,
“the typical temple of the Egyptian Empire,”
is to create an entire misapprehension in the
mind of anyone who hears such a phrase used.
Karnak is anything but a typical temple; indeed
it is not a temple, but rather an aggregate of many
temples, and above everything else an epitome of
Egyptian history for at least a millennium and a
half. One would not even seek it for typical
representatives of Egyptian architecture. Karnak,
in this respect, possesses its beauties—and its
monstrosities; but one would look rather to
smaller specimens of the builder’s art for an
adequate representation of Egyptian achievement
in this respect.</p>

<p>The great temple claims, and will always claim,
our attention and wonder, by its sheer vastness,
to begin with, for undoubtedly vastness has its
own effect, though it is not the highest, in the
elements of architectural impressiveness; then
by the extraordinary way in which it presents a
summary in stone of the vicissitudes of Egyptian
history; last, and perhaps least, by the surprising
quality, and in some instances the beauty, of some
of its detail. The main element in its appeal
will always be wonder; admiration, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
that qualified by many reservations, is a bad
second to the impression of simple amazement,
that human hands and brains should have ever
wrought so vast a thing.</p>

<p>The preservation of the temple is, and will
continue to be, a work almost as great, and as
difficult, as its erection. It lies in the hands of
the Egyptian Service of Antiquities, and is a
task as unending as the web of Penelope.
Generally speaking, such work is of the kind
which has to be its own reward, for it makes
no appeal to the average visitor, who only sees
that his enjoyment of this court or that is more
or less hindered by the progress of work
whose one merit is that it will keep safe for
future generations priceless treasures which otherwise
would ere long pass away. Sometimes,
however, the work does bring other prizes in its
train.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">16. LUXOR, FORECOURT OF AMENHOTEP III.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Such was the case when, in November, 1903,
M. Legrain, in the course of his work near the
pylon of Thothmes III by which we returned
to the central court after our digression to the
south, found what has since been known as “the
Karnak Cachette,” a great pit full of pieces of
sculpture of all types and periods. “For a year
and eight months,” wrote Maspero in February,
1905, “we have been fishing for statues in the
Temple of Karnak.... Seven hundred stone
monuments have already come out of the water,
and we are not yet at the end.... Statues whole
and in fragments, busts, mutilated trunks, headless
bodies, bodiless heads, vases on which there were
only broken feet, Pharaohs enthroned, queens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
standing upright, priests of Amon and individuals
holding naos, or images of gods, in front of them,
crouching, kneeling, sitting, found in all the
attitudes of their profession or rank, in limestone,
in black or pink granite, in yellow or red sandstone,
in green breccia, in schist, in alabaster—indeed,
a whole population returns to the upper
air and demands shelter in the galleries of the
Museum.”</p>

<p>The reason for the existence of this extraordinary
dump of discarded sculpture, whose
richness Maspero’s vivacious sentences do not
in the least exaggerate, and which gave us, to
mention only two examples, the masterly pink
granite head of Senusert III, one of the most
brilliant examples of XIIth Dynasty sculpture,
and the schist Thothmes III, equally one of
the finest examples of the art of the New Empire,
seems to have been this. The Ptolemies, the
presence of whose coins in the pit sufficiently
dates it, did a great deal of building at Karnak,
and in the course of their cleaning up of the
places where they worked, they, no doubt, came
on an infinity of out-of-date <i lang="la">ex voto</i> statues, some
of them broken, some of them whole, but all
rather a nuisance and obstruction, as the persons
with whom they were associated had long since
ceased to be of importance. What was to be
done with them? They could not simply be
thrown out as rubbish, for they had been dedicated
to the god, and were therefore sacred;
and they could not be allowed to stand littering
up the courts which the Ptolemies were busily
tidying. Accordingly the great pit was dug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
within the sacred enclosure, and Senusert,
Thothmes, Senmut, and hundreds of other old
Egyptian notables were consigned to its muddy
depths, thence to be resurrected, more than two
thousand years later, by their degenerate descendants,
who baled out the water from the pit with
old petroleum cans, and hoisted Pharaoh, High-priest
or Statesman, unceremoniously out of his
dark resting-place with lever and tackle. It has
been a fortunate chance for us, for Egyptian
portrait-sculpture might stake its reputation on
the two pieces which I have mentioned, and the
pit has yielded scores almost as good.</p>

<p>The work of preserving the building, and
putting it in a condition of safety for the future,
has had a curious interest from the fact that in
its progress Karnak has been to some extent
rebuilt, and by exactly the same methods by
means of which it was built in the beginning.
For there can be little doubt, in spite of all talk
about the wonderful mechanical knowledge of
the ancient Egyptians, and their possession of
secrets which have been lost to our time, that
Karnak, like all the great Egyptian buildings,
was built, not by means of any of these remarkable
secrets which never existed save in the imagination
of those who have talked about them, but by the
disciplined and ordered use of the very simplest
means known to man, the inclined plane, the
lever, and any amount of obedient human
muscle. These were the mechanical secrets
which M. Legrain found most useful and most
economical in the end of the nineteenth century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, as those who had gone before him had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
in the nineteenth, the fifteenth, the fourth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Senusert, Thothmes, Hatshepsut,
Sety, Ramses, Sheshanq, Taharqa, Ptolemy, they
all built Karnak by sheer force of human labour,
disciplined and guided by a race of builders who
for thousands of years had specialised in the
training of men for such tasks, and with no more
marvellous secrets to aid them than those oldest
of man’s mechanical triumphs, the ramp and the
lever. M. Legrain has repeated their miracles
with the same equipment; and in an age of
machinery has shown that the human machine
may still be the most adequate, the most adaptable,
and the most economical.</p>

<p>Thus, then, we have seen, at two of the most
interesting sites in Egypt, something of the
work which has been going on with the double
object of extending our knowledge of the past
and of preserving its treasures for the future.
Realising something of the importance of such
buildings as Der el-Bahri and Karnak, and their
scores of companions throughout the land,
buildings which are, in effect, ancient Egypt to
us, one can feel that work such as that which has
been meagrely described in these pages, unspectacular
though it may be compared with the
work of Pharaoh-hunting, is yet of great and
enduring importance, the indispensable fabric
on which the glittering embroidery of the
treasure-troves from the Valley of the Kings and
elsewhere is wrought, and without whose rich
and durable substance to form a background the
golden glory of the royal tombs would lose half
its meaning and beauty.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> the most curious of ancient Egyptian
documents are the two papyri, the Abbott
and the Amherst, which tell the story of
the robberies of the royal tombs at Thebes, which
came to light in the reign of Ramses IX, about
1100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> At that time the capital city was ruled,
under the Governor, by a certain noble named
Paser, who was called “The Prince of the Town.”
Western Thebes, however, the City of the Dead,
was not under the care of Paser, but was supervised
by another official named Pewero, who
rejoiced in the title of “Prince of the West.”
Between the Prince of the Town and the Prince
of the West there was no love lost, as is not
uncommon with the heads of two adjacent jurisdictions;
and Paser, on the eastern bank of the
river, kept his ears open to all the tittle-tattle of
discontented workmen from the Necropolis which
drifted across the river. It so fell out in the
sixteenth year of Ramses IX, that certain thefts
from the Necropolis were reported by the Prince
of the West to the Governor; and Paser seized
the opportunity of making the most to the Council
of the laxity of administration which allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
such things, and of suggesting that infinitely
worse robberies, involving the Royal Tombs,
were occurring under his enemy’s jurisdiction.</p>

<p>A special commission was appointed to
investigate the charges, and the importance of the
case is shown by the rank of the members of
the court. These were Khaemuas, the Governor,
“The Royal Vassal Nesamen, Scribe of Pharaoh,”
<i>i.e.</i> the King’s private Secretary, and “The Royal
Vassal Neferkara-em-per-Amen, the Speaker of
Pharaoh,” doubtless the King’s Public Orator.
This august court went at great length into the
charges, and it is impossible to read the account
of the case without feeling that Paser had right
on his side, though he rather made a bungle of
his case. Obviously his information was mainly
derived from ill-natured gossip, for it was so
inaccurate in detail that the very royal tomb
which he positively declared to have been robbed
was found on examination to be untouched;
but equally obviously there was a great deal
going on in the Necropolis which should not
have gone on, and Pewero either connived at the
thefts or was culpably careless.</p>

<p>On the whole Paser failed to establish his
charges, though in one case, to be mentioned
directly, there was plain evidence of the violation
of a royal tomb. The Prince of the Town took
his failure rather badly, and spoke wild whirling
words before a riotous deputation of Necropolis
workmen, which got him into trouble; but bit
by bit the actual truth leaked out, though not in
the Commission.</p>

<p>Three years later, in the reign of Ramses X,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
sixty persons, mainly priests and officials of the
Necropolis, were arrested on the charge of
complicity in the thefts; and even this big bag
of robbers did not bring security to the royal
dead. Ere long the priests of the dead kings were
frantically hustling the mummies of their dead
masters from one tomb to another in the vain
attempt to put them beyond the reach of the
spoilers, until at last the bulk of the great Theban
Pharaohs were gathered, or rather huddled,
together, in the obscure shaft of the unfinished
tomb of Queen Astemkheb at Der el-Bahri, or
in the tomb of Amenhotep II in the Valley of
the Kings.</p>

<p>The kind of treatment which was meted out
to the mighty dead by the sacrilegious rascals
in the Theban Necropolis is detailed for us in
the confession of one of them, a confession
extracted, for the rest, by the time-honoured
Eastern questionary of the bastinado. “We
found the august mummy of this god,” says the
thief, describing his work at the tomb of King
Sebek-em-saf and his wife Queen Nub-khas,
“with a long chain of golden amulets and
ornaments round the neck; the head was covered
with gold. The august mummy of this god
was entirely overlaid with gold, and his coffin
was covered both within and without with gold,
and adorned with every splendid costly stone.
We stripped off the gold which we found on the
august mummy of this god, as well as the amulets
and ornaments from around the neck, and the
bandages in which the mummy was wrapped.
We found the royal wife equipped in like manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
and we stripped off all that we found upon
her. We burnt her bandages, and we also stole
the household goods which we found with
them, and the gold and silver vessels. We
divided all between us; we divided into eight
parts the gold which we found with this god,
the mummies, the amulets, the ornaments and
the bandages.”</p>

<p>Such was the treatment accorded to a Pharaoh
of Egypt by one of his subjects three thousand
years ago; a curious commentary on the present-day
Egyptian protests against the opening of
the royal tombs in the interests of science!
But the story of the Ramesside tomb-robberies
is only an illustration of two contradictory cravings
which are seen working all down the long
record of the Egyptian monarchy. On the one
hand there is the constant attempt of royalty
to secure for itself by the most elaborate precautions
that age-long endurance of the physical
frame which was deemed a necessary condition
for the welfare of the dead king in the Underworld,
an attempt which expresses itself in
different ways, some of them most wonderful,
in the successive periods of Egyptian history;
on the other, there is the equally constant and
resolute determination of the Egyptian tomb-robber
that not all the divinity which doth hedge
a king, and especially a Pharaoh, shall keep him
from his prey. The Ramesside thief has any
amount of lip-reverence for the dead king whose
rest he so rudely disturbs; but all the time that
he is talking about “the august mummy of this
god,” he is stripping the gold and jewels from it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
and his accomplices are kindling the fire which
will shortly destroy, from an Egyptian point of
view, King Sebek-em-saf’s hope of immortality;
and the contradiction is an epitome of a good
deal in the story of Egyptian royalty.</p>

<p>The most enduring religious feeling in the
Egyptian was the craving for immortality; and
the most permanent, as it was one of the earliest
religious convictions, was that immortality was
linked with faith in the god Osiris, who, as the
legend ran, had been treacherously slain by his
brother Set, had risen from the dead, had been
judged and pronounced just by the tribunal of
the gods, and thenceforth reigned as the god of
the Underworld and the judge of the dead.</p>

<p>The devout Egyptian believed that after
death, if the necessary conditions had been
fulfilled on his behalf, he was identified with
his god, and like him rose again, was justified,
and admitted to the Egyptian Elysian Fields.
These conditions, briefly stated, were, first, the
continuance for as long a period as possible, of
the body, in a state as closely as possible resembling
that of life. Whether this need, which, of
course, was responsible for the characteristically
Egyptian practice of mummification, sprang from
the belief that the spiritual essence of the dead
man might find a resting-place after death in
the mummified shell of its living abode, or
whether the creation of the mummy was merely,
as Professor Peet asserts, a counsel of despair,
an attempt to deny death for as long as possible,
is not certain; but the attempt to preserve the
body, first by the provision of a secure tomb, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
later by mummification as well, endures through
the whole of Egyptian history. The second
condition was the provision of food and drink,
and all the comforts of life, for the dead man in
his tomb. The third was the equipping of him
with all the words of power which would enable
him to escape the dangers which haunted the
ways of the Underworld, and to pass the ordeal
of the judgment, and with amulets which would
prove efficacious in warding off the assaults of
the demons of the Underworld. Last of all,
as in the Elysian Fields there was work to be
done, and it was not fitting that a king or a great
noble should stoop to manual labour, the dead
man had to be provided with simulacra of servants
who should answer for him when he was called
upon for service, and take upon themselves his
burden of labour.</p>

<p>Out of all these conditions there arose
gradually the whole wealth of Egyptian funerary
equipment, as it is found in the tombs of the
great men of the land, and above all in those of
the Pharaohs, an equipment whose splendour
has dazzled the whole world in the revelations
of the tomb of Tutankhamen. From the very
earliest times the kings of Egypt were laid to
rest with elaborate provision for the wants of
the dead monarch, and the provision grew in
completeness and complexity with each successive
generation, till it reached its culmination in the
gorgeous tombs of the Theban Pharaohs of
the New Empire, with their hundreds of feet of
rock-hewn chamber and corridor, their glittering
canopies, their nests of gilded coffins, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
wealth of costly amulets and illuminated papyri,
their stores of ushabtis, and, at the heart of all,
the wonderfully preserved mummy of the man
for whom all this magnificence had been prepared.</p>

<p>It may be questioned, however, whether all
these precautions did not rather tend to defeat
their own end, and whether Pharaoh might not
have slumbered in greater security had his tomb
been less gorgeous and less richly equipped than
he could hope to do when his tomb was a wonder
of the world, and when all men knew that
wealth untold was stored within its dark depths.
At all events we know that from the earliest days
of the Egyptian kingdom to the latest the kings
were few indeed whose rest was not rudely broken
by the sacrilegious hands of robbers. The fate
of King Sebek-em-saf, already described, is
typical of that of the royal tombs in general.
For five thousand years human greed has proved
more powerful than human piety or even than
human superstition. To-day, the professional
tomb-robber of native birth, though his activities
are as skilfully conducted as ever, finds a rival
in the scientific explorer, whose disturbance of
the rest of the royal dead, though there are still
many who object to the work as a profanation
of what all men should regard as sacred, is at
least conducted with as much reverence as
possible, and in the interests not of individual
greed of gain, but of the general sum of knowledge
of the human race.</p>

<p>In this respect the situation should be clearly
understood. It is not a question of whether the
dead kings of ancient Egypt shall or shall not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
be allowed to rest in peace in their tombs. That
question has been settled, and settled in the
negative, for many centuries by the persistent
habit of the Egyptians themselves. Robbed the
tombs of the Pharaohs (such of them as still
remain undisturbed) will inevitably be. That
is as sure as death itself. The only question
is whether the robbery shall be conducted by
ignorant fellahin for the sake of private gain,
and in such a fashion that the whole of the results
shall be scattered among a score of private collections,
and all their historic value forever lost,
or whether it shall be conducted in orderly and
scientific fashion, the finds duly catalogued in
their true order, and gathered together in one
great assemblage in a place where they can be
studied in their true relation to one another, and
to other finds of similar character.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to which of these
methods is preferable. To deny to the man of
science the opportunity of investigating the
history, the art, and the life of the past as revealed
in the treasures of the royal tombs is simply to
make it certain that, without securing in the least
the sanctity of the tombs, all the knowledge
which might have been drawn from them shall
be lost forever to the world. This is the sufficient
justification of those excavations which, in spite
of all the interest created by their revelations,
have so often created also a feeling of repugnance
and protest.</p>

<p>The story of the royal tombs of Egypt begins
with the excavation of the Sacred City of Osiris,
Abydos. The work there is by no means the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
earliest in point of time of the series of discoveries
which have been made in connection
with the burial of royalty, though Abydos was
one of the sites excavated by Mariette, who
revealed to the world the wonderful XIXth
Dynasty work of the temple of Sety I there.
Much had been discovered at Thebes and at
Memphis before Amélineau and Petrie began
at Abydos those researches which have revolutionised
our knowledge of early Egyptian history
and civilisation, and have given back to us several
centuries of the story of human effort which had
previously been shrouded in darkness; but it
seems best to follow the subject down the line
of history rather than to follow the order of
discovery with its consequent mixing up of all
the dynasties and periods.</p>

<p>Up to the nineties of last century, it may be
said that practically nothing was known of those
earliest Kings of Egypt who reigned before the
time of the IVth Dynasty. The history of
Egypt began with the Pyramid-builders, Khufu,
Khafra, and Menkaura; and so far as any real
knowledge went, Egyptian civilisation sprang,
like Athene, full-armed and full grown into
being, and offered to the world as its firstfruits
the most gigantic structures ever reared by the
hand of man.</p>

<figure id="il_18" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 41em;">
  <img src="images/i_136.jpg" width="1988" height="1336" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">18. COLONNADE IN TEMPLE OF SETY I, ABYDOS.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Obviously this was an impossibility, for
things do not happen thus in real life, and the
advance of civilisation is a business, not of leaps
and bounds, but of slow and ordered progress;
but before the Pyramid-builders there was
nothing in Egyptian history but a gulf of misty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
darkness, in which a few dim and mighty shapes
could be faintly discerned through the clouds.
Manetho, the Egyptian historian of Sebennytos,
preserved in the few fragments of his story which
have survived the names, and a few more or
less incredible legends, of the great men who
had lived and reigned before the Pyramid-period;
but they were only shadows, and the
bulk of what little he told us of them was too
fantastic to command any respect. The chief
figure of his story was the king Menes, or Mena,
who was said to have founded Memphis, and who
seemed to have some semblance of reality among
the pale shades of the others; but even he came
to us in Manetho’s pages in such a questionable
shape as to seem more a figure of romance than
of fact.</p>

<p>The discoveries of the closing years of the
nineteenth century, however, have put an end
to all that vagueness, and while our knowledge
about the earliest dynastic kings of Egypt is
still scanty enough, it is quite solid and real as
far as it goes. Not only so, but excavation has
resulted in the extension of knowledge to the
period before the rise of the earliest dynastic
rulers, and such a mass of material has been
accumulated bearing on the life of the pre-dynastic
Egyptians as to justify Professor Peet’s
statement, “it may reasonably be said that we
are as well acquainted with the material civilisation
of this era as with that of any other in
Egyptian history, though at the same time it
has to be admitted that our knowledge of its
actual history amounts to practically nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>With the pre-dynastic tombs, however, and
with their comparatively meagre provision for
the dead, we have not to do at present. All
that need be said is that the pre-dynastic Egyptian
buried his dead in a shallow pit cut in the sand
or the soft rock, the body being laid on its side
in a crouching posture, the knees drawn up
towards the chin, and the hands placed in a
supplicating attitude before the face. Around
the dead man, who was often covered with a
reed mat, were placed the vases for food and
drink, the various utensils, flint knives, ivory
tablets, and suchlike things which were held
to be necessary or useful for him in the life
beyond, and above all the carved slate palette
which was used for grinding the green face-paint
in which the early Egyptian delighted, and
the material for making the paint itself.</p>

<p>From these early tombs we have learned
that the pre-dynastic Egyptian was far from being
an uncultured savage. His funerary equipment,
primitive as it is in some respects, shows us that
he had already acquired the rudiments of that
art of representing human and animal form which
was to be carried to such remarkable heights in
the dynastic period; he was an accomplished
potter, whose vessels, though he was as yet
ignorant of the potter’s wheel, are so perfectly
moulded by hand that the absence of the wheel
is no loss, and who “belonged to one of those
rare and happy periods when the craftsman
seems incapable of an error of taste, and in
consequence almost every form that leaves his
hands is a thing of beauty”; and he had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
inexhaustible patience and an amazing skill in
the working of vessels of the hardest stone which
make the pre-dynastic hard stoneware the
standard of quality by which all succeeding
periods are judged.</p>

<p>The disclosure of the tombs of the true early
dynastic period, as distinguished from the earlier
tombs which we have been describing, was to
come from the Holy City of ancient Egypt—Abydos.
The reason for the fact that the royal
tombs of this period are to be found in the
neighbourhood of a town which was never the
capital of the land, and not at such important
cities as Memphis or Thebes, is, of course, that
Abydos had a sanctity to which no other place
in Egypt could lay claim, as the burial-place of
the head of the God of the Resurrection, Osiris,
after his slaughter and dismemberment by Set.
Osiris was not the original god of the dead at
Abydos, for there existed, long before his supremacy,
the worship of a local god Khenti—“The
First of the Westerners,” whose place Osiris
usurped, or rather with whom he was identified.
But from a very early date Osiris was supreme
at Abydos. Every devout Egyptian desired to
be buried, if possible, at Abydos, and as close as
might be to the burial-place of the God of the
Resurrection; if actual burial was impossible, as
in the vast majority of cases, the next best thing
was to be allowed to set up a memorial slab in
the neighbourhood, or to make a pilgrimage,
even after death, to the Holy City, before being
laid in the less holy ground elsewhere; while
if none of these expedients was feasible, at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
one could send a little votive vase of common
pottery, and have it laid near to the sacred site.
Accordingly the Necropolis at Abydos is full of
memorials of all periods of Egyptian history,
and in particular the ground is so crowded with
broken pottery of all ages and types that the
Arabs call the place “Umm el-Ga’ab,” “The
Mother of Pots.”</p>

<p>It was on this site that M. Amélineau began
his excavations in 1895, continuing them till
the spring of 1898. He discovered several large
chamber tombs, which contained many articles
of exquisite workmanship, vases, and plaques in
fine stone and in pottery, ebony and ivory tablets,
bearing inscriptions in archaic hieroglyphics, and
evidence that the tombs had belonged to kings
of Egypt earlier in date than the period of the
Pyramid-builders. In particular he found the
tomb of a king whose name he read as Khent,
and whom he identified with Osiris himself,
as one of the titles of the god is “Khent-Amenti.”
In January, 1898, he found in this tomb part of
a skull which he conjectured to be the skull of
the god, and on the same day his workmen
unearthed a granite bier of familiar Egyptian
shape to which he gave the name of “The Bed
of Osiris.”</p>

<p>Had these attributions been established M.
Amélineau’s discoveries, important enough in
themselves, would have been absolutely unique
in character. But the somewhat acrimonious
discussion which followed the announcement of
the finds, established the fact that though he had
discovered the tomb of one of the earliest kings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
of Egypt it was the tomb of a man, and not of
a god. The Bed of Osiris proved to be a New
Empire copy of some more ancient bier placed
there by Egyptians who had made the same
mistake as the modern explorer, and imagined
that they were restoring the actual tomb of the
god of the Underworld. The great discovery
thus failed to produce the effect which its importance
deserved, and rather cast ridicule upon the
possibility of retrieving for serious history the
period of the earliest dynasties. M. Amélineau
shortly afterwards abandoned his uncompleted
task, believing that the site was completely worked
out, and for a time Abydos remained without
any further attempts to unravel its mysteries.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1899–1900, however, Professor
Flinders Petrie began work on the abandoned
site, and the results of his patient and skilful
study have been of supreme importance for
the reconstruction of this earliest period of the
history of the ancient Egyptian kingdom. He
not only found in the tombs already discovered
a great quantity of valuable material, but added
considerably to the number of known tombs,
and planned with the utmost care all those which
came to light. In the main, these royal tombs
of the earliest dynasties proved to conform to a
single type, though the variations in size and in
the number of apartments are considerable.
Generally speaking, there is a large central
chamber, dug in the soil, and sometimes
approached by a stairway. This chamber, which
we may believe to have been the actual royal
sepulchre, is lined, and sometimes floored, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
wood, though in some instances the flooring is
of stone, in one case of granite, the earliest known
examples of stonework. Around the central
chamber are grouped smaller cells, in which
were stored the provision for the use of the dead
king in the Underworld, or where the bodies of
his favourites who were doomed to accompany
him in his dark journey were laid after they had
been slain during his funeral rites.</p>

<p>The great tomb of King Kha-sekhem of the
IInd Dynasty, 223 feet by 54 feet, is unique in
the fact that its central chamber, 10 feet by 17 feet,
and nearly 6 feet deep, is entirely built of stone,
and is the earliest known example of a piece of
mason-work. Each tomb, when it was completed
and occupied, was roofed with wooden beams,
and above it the sand was piled in a low mound,
the precursor of the great stone burial mounds
which were to appear ere long when the pride of
the IVth Dynasty monarchs was no longer
content with anything less than a pyramid for
its memorial. Above the tomb a pair of grave-steles
bearing the king’s name were placed, so
that the royal cemetery of Abydos must have
presented an appearance not unlike that of a
modern churchyard with its mounds and its
headstones.</p>

<p>No royal bodies, of course, were found in
these earliest tombs. Time and the tomb-robber
had done their work too well for that,
and the art of mummification was as yet unknown.
At a very early date the tombs had been rifled,
and some of them burned, no doubt in the
process of disposing of the bodies after they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
been plundered, as the Ramesside robber disposed
of the mummy of Sebek-em-saf. The most
unquestionably personal relic discovered was the
shrivelled arm of the queen of King Zer, which
had been stolen by some robber who had not
time to carry off his plunder, and had thrust it
into a hole in the tomb wall, where it was found,
with its four beautiful bracelets still intact, by
one of Petrie’s workmen. What was left in the
tombs is simply what previous robbers had not
deemed worth the trouble of carrying away.
Yet these pieces of pottery, these broken bits
of ivory furniture, these ebony and ivory plaques,
with their archaic inscriptions, have proved of
inestimable importance; for they have enabled
us to fashion in our minds a picture, rude enough,
no doubt, and sadly lacking in detail, but unquestionably
true in its main outline of the earliest
ordered civilisation in the history of the world.</p>

<p>We can see that by 3500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the very latest
date to which the Ist Dynasty can be brought
down (Petrie dates it from 5500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), the Egyptian
state, under “The Scorpion,” Narmer, or
Aha-men, the group of kings who probably
stand for the Menes of Manetho’s story,
had long and completely emerged from the
barbarism which swathed the rest of the world
save Babylonia, and possibly Crete, and was
already thoroughly organised and master of
all its own resources. War, which had produced
the union of the two sections of the land, the
Delta and the Upper Valley, was carried on, not
as a matter of chance razzias, but with the movement
of great armies which could sweep a whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
populace into their net. The great mace-head
of King Narmer records the capture of 120,000
men, 400,000 oxen, and 1,422,000 goats. The
same king has in his train a Leader of the Ceremonies,
a title which shows that the etiquette
of the court was already thoroughly organised,
and at an early date the Commander of the
Inundation shows by his presence that the
Egyptian already realised the importance of this
great annual event, which, indeed, was no doubt
the compelling cause which resulted in the
extraordinarily early growth of organisation in
Egypt as compared with other lands.</p>

<p>That the equipment of the royal household
was sumptuous and tasteful, and that the personal
adornments of the glittering figures who occupied
its stage were of the richest material and of the
highest artistic quality, even the pitiful relics
which have survived are sufficient to assure
us. Pharaoh’s palace was adorned with vases
and bowls of diorite, breccia, rock-crystal, and
alabaster, wrought with matchless skill, and
ground to translucent thinness; his furniture
was of ebony and ivory exquisitely carved and
adorned with hammered gold. Nor was the
glow of beautiful colour wanting to the picture;
for the Egyptian craftsman had already mastered
that art of glazing objects with brilliant colour
which his successors practised with such satisfying
results. The ladies of the court found that
the goldsmith was capable of meeting their
desire for costly and tasteful jewellery in a
fashion that has never been surpassed, and the
bracelets of the Queen of Zer, of amethyst,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
turquoise, lazuli, and gold, are of fine design
and astonishingly good workmanship; while
the existence of a Court barber is attested by
the plait of false hair which was found in the
tomb of Zer, and was perhaps worn by the lady
of the bracelets.</p>

<p>The art of hieroglyphic writing was already
fully established, and though the hieroglyphics
are archaic in form, they are quite intelligible.
In many of the tombs are found small ivory
plaques, “made by the king’s carpenter.” These
are inscribed, each with the records of the events
of a single year; so that we have evidence of
a regular system of chronicling. The British
Museum possesses the lid of the ivory box in
which King Semti kept his Great Seal—“The
Golden Seal of Judgment of King Den”—so
that manifestly official documents were in existence,
and had to be authenticated by the royal
seal. Of art, nothing on a large scale has
survived; but the artist who carved the little
ivory statuette of a king (perhaps Semti) wearing
the White Crown, and clothed in a long parti-coloured
robe, was already, within his limits, a
master; and Professor Petrie says of the statuette
of Kha-sekhem of the IInd Dynasty, found at
Hierakonpolis, “the art of these figures shows
a complete mastery of sculpture, the face being
more delicately modelled than almost any later
work.” Altogether we must conceive of the
Court of the earliest Dynastic Kings of Egypt
as being organised on a high plane of luxury,
and indeed of comparative refinement. There
is little that can be called barbaric, save the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
possible survival of the custom of slaying the
king’s favourites to accompany him in his
journey through the Underworld.</p>

<p>The results of this exploration of the resting-places
of the first buried royalties of Egypt may
not in themselves be imposing, when compared
with the bewildering wealth of some of the later
royal interments; but their importance is not
to be measured by mere quantity or richness in
the precious metals, but by the fact that they have
given to us a revelation of a whole period of
human activity which was previously hidden
beneath the mists of antiquity. Viewed in this
light it becomes apparent that these poor fragments
from the tombs of Abydos have a value
far exceeding that of many much more gorgeous
finds, and scarcely surpassed by the discoveries
of any period. They stand, in this respect, on
the same level with the revelation of the Minoan
civilisation at Knossos, or that of the city-states
of Sumer at Lagash.</p>

<p>The search for the buried royalties of Egypt
next brings us into touch with the great age of
the Pyramid-builders, beginning with Zeser
and Seneferu, and extending, with gradually
diminishing splendour, down to the last relics
of the XIIth Dynasty—a period which has
already been dealt with in detail. It is followed
by the dark period which witnessed the incursion
and supremacy of the Hyksos kings, and the
War of Independence—a troubled period from
which few relics have survived, though the
account of the robbery of the tomb of King
Sebek-em-saf of the XIIIth Dynasty, with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
our chapter began, shows that the kings of even
these dark days were laid to rest with at least
something of the ancient splendour of Egyptian
royalty.</p>

<p>When we resume our story, we find that two
great changes have taken place, one in the course
of the national history, the other in the burial
customs with which we have to deal. The
centre of gravity of the Empire has shifted from
the area south of the Delta, embracing Saqqara,
Memphis, and the Fayum, to the great city
from which the Theban princes had been directing
the struggle against the Hyksos; and henceforward,
throughout all the most brilliant period
of Egyptian history, Thebes remains almost
exclusively the royal abode, and, particularly
for our purpose, the place where the great
monarchs of the New Empire were buried in
the midst of all their magnificence.</p>

<p>Along with this political change has gone
another, which has completely revolutionised
the funerary customs consecrated by so long
usage. The resting-place of a Pharaoh is no
longer marked by a “star-y-pointing Pyramid,”
with its temple and causeway. The tombs of
the great nobles of the Middle Kingdom at
Beni Hasan and elsewhere had already been
indicating a change in the funerary ideal, and
the temple of Mentuhotep at Der el-Bahri, with
its combination of pyramid and rock-hewn
shrine, may perhaps be looked upon as the compromise
between the old ideal and the new.
Henceforward the actual tomb and the funerary
temple were to be separated by the necessities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
of the locality in which the first was situated.
The Temple was to stand by itself, free in the
open plain on the western bank of the Nile;
the Tomb was to be hidden from human knowledge,
so far as possible, in a wild and desolate
valley of the Libyan hills behind the plain and
its girdling cliffs.</p>

<figure id="il_20" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 42em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">20. ENTRANCE TO THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS, THEBES.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the western bank of the Nile, opposite
Thebes, there lies a great bay of the Libyan
cliffs, extending for more than two miles from
the ruined palace of Amenhotep III and the
temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu on the
south, to Drah Abu’l Neggah and the temple
of Sety I at Qurneh on the north. From cape
to cape of the bay there stretches, like the string
of a bow, a row of ruined funerary temples,
built by most of the notable Theban Pharaohs.
Beyond the line of the string towards the Nile,
the two Memnon colossi still keep watch and
ward—all that remains of the most gorgeous of
all the western temples, reared by the most
gorgeous of Theban Pharaohs—Amenhotep III;
while between the string and the bow, and
clinging close to the curving cliffs, lie the temples
of Der el-Medinet and Der el-Bahri. Beyond
the northern nock of the bow at Drah Abu’l
Neggah, a rugged winding path leads north-westwards
into the heart of the hills for about
a mile, then turning sharply westwards, it reveals
a forked valley, one branch of which is known
as the West Valley, and the other and more
important as the East Valley. Together these
two ravines make up the Biban el-Moluk, or
Valley of the Kings, the most famous place of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
royal sepulture in the world, where for a thousand
years the kings of the earliest of world-empires
were laid “all of them in glory, everyone in his
own house.”</p>

<p>They chose for their resting-place one of
the wildest and most barren scenes which it
is possible to imagine, a sun-scorched wilderness
of rock and tumbled stone, where the heat,
reverberated from rock to rock under a sky of
brass, is like that of Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace.
But it was not beauty or richness that they were
seeking when they came to the Valley of the
Kings; it was the security which not even the
Great Pyramid had been able to give to the mighty
dead. The loneliness and desolation of the
place were the very things which prompted its
selection; for they sought—how vainly the
future was to show—a place where human foot
had never trod, and where they might expect
that their long sleep would be unbroken by any
intruder. The sacrilegious attempts of the type
of robber who had scattered to the winds the
dust of Khufu they foresaw, and tried, though
with only imperfect success, to guard against;
what they could not foresee was the advent of
the scientific excavator, with a patience which
rivals and a skill which far surpasses that of
the native plunderer, whose work has put the
crown on the lengthy demonstration of the futility
of all their pathetic efforts at security.</p>

<p>The type of tomb which is characteristic of
the Valley of the Kings is simple enough in its
general idea, though its development is sometimes
complex enough. An entrance gallery is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
driven into the rock sloping downwards, the
passage-way being sometimes an inclined plane,
sometimes a stairway. This corridor is sometimes
interrupted by a deep pit, possibly meant
to catch any water which might flow in through
the doorway, but more probably to render the
task of the robber more difficult. Beyond the
pit, the passage is continued, and gives access
to chambers and halls varying in number and
size, until at last the sarcophagus chamber is
reached. Of this general type there are all
varieties, from the simplicity of such a tomb as
that of Tutankhamen, with its short entrance
passage, and its scanty provision of poorly
decorated rooms, to the complexity of the tombs
of Ramses III or Sety I, with their hundreds of
feet of corridor and chamber, brilliantly decorated
with the finest art which their time could produce.</p>

<p>The decoration of the royal tombs, though
often of high quality artistically, is generally
of a sombre and gloomy character, differing in
this from the brilliant pictures of life which are
characteristic of the Old Kingdom tombs of the
nobles at Saqqara, or even from some of the
private tombs, such as those of Nekht and
Rekhmara at Thebes. Generally speaking,
the leading conception is that the dead king,
accompanied by the sun-god or identified with
him, sails in the bark of Ra through the Underworld,
bringing light as he passes. On his
voyage he is accompanied by all manner of
spirits and genii, which ward off the enemies of
the soul from the divine boat. The subjects
of the illustrations are largely derived from two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
books of funerary ritual, <cite>The Book of Him
Who is in the Duat</cite> (Underworld), and <cite>The
Book of the Gates</cite>, while portions of the <cite>Book
of the Dead</cite> are also illustrated.</p>

<p>These wonderful tombs have always been
more or less known in historic times. Strabo
mentions that there were in his time forty tombs
worthy of a visit, and we may be sure that the
bulk of these had already been long rifled, or at
least cleared of their contents to avoid the danger
of desecration, before the Egyptian Empire ended
its long course. The centuries between the
visit of the old geographer and that of the scholars
of the French Expedition had brought oblivion
to the majority of the tombs, for the French
explorers mention only eleven, the others having
meanwhile got covered up and forgotten.</p>

<p>It is with the coming of Belzoni on his second
journey in 1817 that the modern search for
buried Pharaohs may be said to begin, and since
his discovery of the tomb of Sety I, the work of
finding Pharaohs has gone on for more than a
century with more or less success, until at the
present time something like sixty tombs have
been found, including a few which are not royal,
and some which are merely pits. The probability
is that few tombs remain to be discovered
in the Valley, for most of the great royalties of
the Empire have now been accounted for in one
way or another.</p>

<p>One chance of some importance, however,
remains. The last king whom we know to
have been buried in the Valley of the Kings is
Ramses XII of the XXth Dynasty. In the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
<em>cache</em> at Der el-Bahri, which will fall to be spoken
of shortly, several of the mummies of kings of the
XXIst Dynasty were found, along with those of
the earlier and more famous lines; but the actual
tombs of the XXIst Dynasty have never yet
come to light, and it is possible that some
fortunate explorer may yet fall, in one of the
desolate valleys among the Libyan hills, on the
necropolis of a line of kings who, if they do
not fill so great a place in the history of Egypt
as their predecessors of the XVIIIth and XIXth
Dynasties, were yet sufficiently important to
make the discovery of their resting-place a matter
of great moment.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was on October 6 that Belzoni began those
excavations in the Valley which resulted in the
discovery of what is still the finest example of
a royal tomb of the Empire. On the 9th he was
fortunate enough to discover two tombs of
considerable importance, one of them beautifully
painted, the other undecorated, but containing
some funerary furniture and two female
mummies. “Their hair,” says Belzoni, whose
summary method of dealing with mummies we
have already noticed, “was pretty long, and well-preserved,
though it was easily separated from
the head by pulling it a little”! On the 11th,
this amazingly fortunate man, who knew so
little the greatness of his good fortune, entered
another tomb, evidently one of still greater
importance, which, with its contents, is dismissed
in half a page of his story. “We found a
sarcophagus of granite, with two mummies in
it, and in a corner a statue standing erect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
6 feet 6 inches high, and beautifully cut out of
sycamore wood; it is nearly perfect except the
nose. We found also a number of little images
of wood, well carved, representing symbolical
figures. Some had a lion’s head, others a fox’s,
others a monkey’s.... In the chamber on our
right hand we found another statue like the first,
but not perfect.” Thus summarily Belzoni
dismisses a discovery which would make most
present-day explorers green with envy. What
became of the two mummies, the two funerary
statues, and the ushabtis, we are not told, but
can easily imagine.</p>

<p>These, however, were only the preliminaries
of the great find which was awaiting the lucky
excavator. On October 16 he started operations
at a point about 15 yards from the tomb already
mentioned (which would seem, therefore, to
have been that of Ramses I), and in a spot which
seemed to his workmen most unlikely to yield
anything. On the 17th they struck the first
indications of a cutting, and on the next day
the entrance of a tomb was laid bare. Before
the close of the day Belzoni had penetrated
into the tomb as far as the antechamber to the
first of its pillared halls, where his progress
was interrupted for the time by a pit 30 feet
deep, which had to be bridged before he could
advance further. Crossing it on the next day,
he gained access to the rest of the tomb, and the
next three weeks he spent as a man in a dream
wandering through the chambers of the great
tomb, and recording to the best of his ability
the wonders which he had been the first to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
for nearly three thousand years. His attempts
at representation of what he saw were imperfect
enough, and his nomenclature of the various
chambers is merely paltry. Titles like “The
Drawing-room,” “The Room of Beauties,”
“The Side-board Room,” seem ludicrously out
of place amidst the sombre dignity of Sety’s
sepulchre. Still Belzoni cannot be denied the
merits of patience and perseverance, and it was
no careless worker who spent a whole twelve-month
in the stifling atmosphere of a tomb in
the Valley of the Kings taking impressions in
wax of all the figures on a tomb which measures
328 feet from end to end.</p>

<p>Belzoni attributed the tomb to Necho and
Psamtek II of the XXVIth Dynasty, finding
evidence to his satisfaction of the attribution in
a procession on the walls, in which he saw
Persians, Jews, and Ethiopians, all of whom,
according to him, “Nichao and Psammethis”
had conquered. He was thus a matter of seven
hundred years out in his dating of his discovery,
for the tomb is that of Sety I of the XIXth
Dynasty, and a monument of the art of the New
Empire just at that point when it had passed its
zenith, and was trembling on the verge of the
decadence, though still capable of the wonders
of Abydos, which are rivalled by some of the
work here. Sety himself, of course, he did not
find in the magnificent alabaster sarcophagus
which stood in one of the pillared halls of the
tomb. Luckily, when we think of how the
explorer would probably have treated him, that
honourable king and valiant soldier had long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
centuries before been removed from his splendid
underground palace to the obscurer but safer
hiding-place where he was discovered in our
own time, and treated with a little more reverence
than he would have received from Belzoni; but
his sarcophagus was in itself a prize more than
sufficient to reward the excavator for all the
labour he had spent.</p>

<p>“It is a sarcophagus,” says the lucky discoverer,
“of the finest Oriental alabaster,
9 feet 5 inches long, and 3 feet 7 inches wide.
Its thickness is only 2 inches; and it is transparent,
when a light is placed in the inside of it.
It is minutely sculptured within and without with
several hundred figures, which do not exceed
2 inches in height.... I cannot give an idea of
this beautiful and invaluable piece of antiquity,
and can only say that nothing has been brought
into Europe from Egypt that can be compared
with it.” He was not far wrong in his enthusiastic
estimate of the artistic value of his find,
as anyone who has seen the exquisite piece of
carving in the Soane Museum will admit.</p>

<p>The fame of Belzoni’s discovery was not
long in reaching the ears of the Turkish officials,
and ere long the chief local authority, Hamed
Aga of Keneh, appeared upon the scene with
a troop of cavalry, having been so eager over
the find that he had made the journey in thirty-six
hours instead of forty-eight. It was no love
for antiquity, however, which had brought him.
All the artistic wonders of the tomb were lost
on him and his following; but they ransacked
every corner of the tomb with great eagerness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
After a long search the Aga dismissed his
soldiers, and turning to Belzoni, he revealed the
true object of his anxiety. “Pray, where have
you put the treasure?” he said. Belzoni’s
denial of the existence of any such thing was
met with an incredulous smile. “I have been
told,” said this characteristic specimen of Turkish
officialdom, “by a person to whom I can give
credit, that you have found in this place a large
golden cock filled with diamonds and pearls.
I must see it. Where is it?” The explorer at
length succeeded in convincing the Aga that
there was nothing to lay hands on, and with
supreme disgust he rose to leave the tomb.
Belzoni asked him what he thought of the beautiful
figures which surrounded him. “He just
gave a glance at them, quite unconcerned, and
said, ‘This would be a good place for a harem,
as the women would have something to look
at.’” Thirty years later, Layard’s experience
of the Turkish official was almost identical with
that of Belzoni.</p>

<p>Forty-two years elapsed before anything of
importance was added to our knowledge of the
buried royalties of Egypt. It was in 1859
the beautiful jewellery of Queen Aah-hotep was
rescued by Mariette from the hands of the worthy
successor of Hamed Aga, as has already been
told. But it was not till 1881 that there occurred
the first of those amazing resurrections of the
Theban Pharaohs which since then have been
repeated on several occasions, culminating with
the discovery of the most splendid of all royal
burials in the tomb of Tutankhamen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>The story of the 1881 find is one of the
romances of excavation, though the credit of it,
if there is any, goes, not to the scientific explorer,
but to the native practitioner of the gentle art
of tomb-robbery. It was in 1876 that evidence
began to accumulate, in the shape of various
papyri and other articles of XXIst Dynasty
date which appeared mysteriously on the market,
that the fellahs of Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh had
somehow or other gained access to some royal
tomb of that period. The Service of Antiquities
took the matter up, and suspicion fell on the
members of a family named Abd-er-Rassoul.
In April, 1881, Maspero arrested with his own
hand Ahmed, one of the members of the family,
and committed him to the tender mercies of
Daoud Pasha, the third Mudir of Keneh who
has appeared in this chapter, but who, unlike
his predecessors, comes in on this occasion on
the side of the angels, so to speak. Justice, in
the Egypt of the eighties, had ways and means
of arriving at its ends which seem strange to
mere Occidentals, and Maspero covers a good
deal in his simple statement that Daoud Pasha
carried on the investigation “with his habitual
severity.” The Ramesside inspectors, in 1100
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, put things more bluntly—“They were
beaten with sticks both on their hands and feet”—but
probably the facts were not very different
in the modern trial. The only result was to
produce a flood of testimony that Ahmed Abd-er-Rassoul
“never had excavated, and never
would excavate, that he was incapable of misappropriating
the tiniest antiquity, to say nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
of violating a royal tomb,” and the spotless
victim of oppression had to be liberated “provisionally.”
“The vigour with which the inquiry
had been conducted by Daoud Pasha” had,
however, impressed the mind of one of the
Abd-er-Rassoul family with the conviction that
there are cases where honesty, or the best possible
imitation of it, is the best policy. Mohammed
Ahmed Abd-er-Rassoul came secretly to the
Mudir, made a clean breast, or at least a breast
as clean as was convenient, to that Rhadamanthus,
and on July 5, 1881, Emile Brugsch Bey, representing
the Service of Antiquities, at last found
the truth about the business, as usual, at the
bottom of a well.</p>

<p>He was led by the penitent sinner Mohammed
to a lonely spot at the foot of the Libyan cliffs,
not far from Hatshepsut’s famous temple at
Der el-Bahri. There, after a long climb up the
hillside, and the scaling of a high cliff, he found
behind a great rock the mouth of a black shaft
about 6 feet square, the well of the unfinished
tomb of Queen Astemkheb of the XXIst Dynasty;
and the story of his experiences may best be
told by himself.</p>

<p>“Finding Pharaoh was an exciting experience
for me. It is true I was armed to the teeth,
and my faithful rifle, full of shells, hung over
my shoulder; but my assistant from Cairo,
Ahmed Effendi Kemal, was the only person with
me whom I could trust. Any one of the natives
would have killed me willingly, had we been
alone, for everyone of them knew better than I
did that I was about to deprive them of a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
source of revenue. But I exposed no sign of
fear, and proceeded with the work. The well
cleared out, I descended, and began the exploration
of the underground passage.”</p>

<p>There are many types of courage; but surely
not the least remarkable is that of the man of
science who allows himself to be lowered on an
Arab rope, down a 40-feet shaft, to explore a
dark gallery of the dead, while the rope which is
his only link with life and light is held above
by a man who would cheerfully have left him
to keep unending vigil beside the Pharaohs whom
he was seeking.</p>

<p>Mohammed’s penitence, however, or perhaps
we had better say, his respect for Daoud Pasha’s
“habitual severity,” kept him true, and Brugsch
had no other terrors to face than those of his
strange task. “Soon,” he says, “we came upon
cases of porcelain funeral offerings, metal and
alabaster vessels, draperies and trinkets, until,
reaching the turn in the passage, a cluster of
mummy-cases came to view in such number as
to stagger me. Collecting my senses, I made
the best examination of them I could by the light
of my torch, and at once saw that they contained
the mummies of royal personages of both sexes;
and yet that was not all. Plunging on ahead of
my guide, I came to the chamber, and there,
standing against the walls, or lying on the floor,
I found even a greater number of mummy-cases
of stupendous size and weight. Their gold
coverings and their polished surfaces so plainly
reflected my own excited visage that it seemed
as though I was looking into the faces of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
own ancestors. The gilt face on the coffin of
the amiable Queen Nefertari seemed to smile
upon me like an old acquaintance.” “The
fellahs,” says Maspero, “had unearthed a
catacomb crammed with Pharaohs.” Among
the mummies were those of several of the most
famous Pharaohs of the New Empire, Seqenen-Ra,
the hero of the War of Independence,
Amenhotep I, and Queen Aahmes Nefertari,
Thothmes II, and Thothmes III, the greatest
soldier of Egyptian history, Sety I, Ramses II,
and Ramses III, the most famous kings of the
XIXth and XXth Dynasties, Pinezem I and
Pinezem II of the XXIst Dynasty, Queen
Hent-taui, Queen Nezem-Mut, and others.</p>

<p>The question of the removal to a place of
security of this astonishing mass of dead royalty
presented its own difficulties. The removal had
to be as speedy as possible, for now that
the secret was out every hour would add to the
danger of a violent attack on the shaft, and the
dispersal for ever of its previous treasures. Yet
the problem of removal was no easy one. The
spot where the shaft lies is lonely and difficult
of access; and the coffins of some of the kings
and queens were of huge size and corresponding
weight. That of Queen Aahmes Nefertari, for
instance, is 10 feet long, and required sixteen
men to lift it.</p>

<p>“Early the next morning,” says Brugsch,
“three hundred Arabs were employed under my
direction—each one a thief. One by one the
coffins were hoisted to the surface, were securely
sewed up in sailcloth and matting, and then were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
carried across the plain of Thebes to the steamers
awaiting them at Luxor.”</p>

<p>It took six days of hard labour, under the
blazing sun of an Egyptian July, before the
tomb was cleared; and then three days more
were spent in waiting for the Museum steamboat
to arrive. Brugsch must have been an anxious
man as he watched the efforts of the three
hundred professional tomb-robbers from whose
hands he was snatching what they regarded
as their legitimate prey; and no doubt he
heaved a sigh of genuine relief when, on July 20,
he handed over his precious freight to the
Museum at Boulak, and was delivered from the
burden of royalty. Sir Gaston Maspero has
told us how all along the Nile, from Luxor to
Quft, both banks of the river were covered with
frantic crowds of fellahs, the women tearing their
hair and wailing, the men firing rifles, as they
followed the downstream progress of the steamer
bearing the mummies. So, no doubt, only without
the rifles and the steam, their ancestors had
followed the funeral barks which bore across
the river the dead bodies of these mighty kings
three thousand years before!</p>

<p>The very richness of the find proved somewhat
of an embarrassment to the authorities at
the Cairo Museum, and it was several years
before the results of Brugsch’s great haul of
Pharaohs were properly sorted out and classified.
It was not till May, 1886, that the unwrapping of
the mummies began, and the task was only
completed in the end of June. The figure of
supreme interest was that of Ramses II, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
was then believed to be the Pharaoh of the
Oppression of the Israelites, and who was then
taken more at the estimate of his own overweening
vanity than he is at present. The mummy of
the great king was solemnly unwrapped in the
presence of an illustrious gathering, the Khedive
of Egypt himself verifying the existence of the
later inscription of the priests of the XXIst
Dynasty on the wrappings around the body,
before the process of unwrapping began. The
state of the mummy agreed with the historical
evidence as to the length of the reign of Ramses.
The king must have been nearly one hundred
years old when he died, and his body bears the
marks of extreme old age.</p>

<p>“The mummy,” says Maspero, “is thin,
much shrunken, and light; the bones are brittle,
and the muscles atrophied, as one would expect
in the case of a man who had attained the age
of a hundred; but the figure is still tall and of
perfect proportions. The mask of the mummy
gives a fair idea of that of the living king;
the somewhat unintelligent expression, slightly
brutish perhaps, but haughty and firm of purpose,
displays itself with an air of royal majesty beneath
the sombre materials used by the embalmer.”</p>

<p>The hero of the battle of Kadesh must in
his prime have been a man of large and powerful
frame. “Even after the coalescence of the
vertebræ and the shrinkage produced by mummification,
his mummy still measures over 5 feet
8 inches”; so that we may picture him as a
formidable figure over 6 feet in height, perhaps
nearer 7 feet with the high war helmet of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Pharaohs crowning his head, as he charged with
arrow drawn to the head, in his rattling war-chariot
upon the Hittite ranks. His conduct at
Kadesh suggests a good trooper, but a dull
general, and his mummy does nothing to cause
a revision of the judgment.</p>

<p>An infinitely nobler figure was that of the
father of Ramses, Sety I, whose mummy was
also found in the <em>cache</em>. “The fine kingly head
was exposed to view,” says Maspero. “It was
a masterpiece of the art of the embalmer, and the
expression of the face was that of one who had
only a few hours previously breathed his last.
Death had slightly drawn the nostrils and
contracted the lips, the pressure of the bandages
had flattened the nose a little, and the skin was
darkened by the pitch; but a calm and gentle
smile still played over the mouth, and the half-open
eyelids allowed a glimpse to be seen from
under their lashes of an apparently moist and
glistening line, the reflection from the white
porcelain eyes let in to the orbit at the time of
burial.” The somewhat gruesome art of the
Egyptian embalmer reached its culmination in
this extraordinary piece of work, and while to
our minds the whole practice verges upon, if
it does not overstep, the limits of the decent
into the realm of the horrible, we may admit
that it comes as near as possible to the attainment
of what Professor Elliot Smith tells us was the
aim of the embalmer—“to make the representation
of the dead man so life-like that he should,
in fact, remain alive.” We should never have
known how noble and dignified a type the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
aristocratic Egyptian of 1300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> had attained
had it not been for the preservation of the grand
head of Sety, which teaches us that the sculptor
of the exquisite reliefs of Abydos was doing no
more than bare justice to his king when he carved
the delicate beauty which charms us to-day.</p>

<p>If the beauty of Sety’s face almost justified
both the morbid skill which sought to deny the
reality of death and the curiosity which unveiled
the secrets of the grave, the same cannot be said
of the mummy of Seqenen-Ra, not the least
interesting of the grim assemblage. There are
few things more ghastly than the head of the
old hero of the Expulsion of the Hyksos, with
three gaping wounds on skull and face, and the
teeth clenched, in the death-agony, upon the
mangled tongue. Yet even this grim evidence
of a violent death on the field of battle seems to
bring the reality of that ancient struggle in which
the Pharaoh died more forcibly home to the
imagination.</p>

<p>A still more horrible figure of nightmare was
that of the unnamed person whose contorted
limbs and writhen countenance suggested to
Maspero the most ghastly of all suspicions as
to how he met his end. “It makes one’s flesh
creep to look at it,” says Maspero, speaking of
this mummy; “the hands and feet are tied by
strong bands, and are curled up as if under an
intolerable pain; the abdomen is drawn up, the
stomach projects like a ball, the chest is contracted,
the head is thrown back, the face is
contorted in a hideous grimace, the retracted
lips expose the teeth, and the mouth is open as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
to give utterance to a last despairing cry. The
conviction is borne in upon us that the man was
invested while still alive with the wrappings of
the dead.” Others have suggested a less horrible
interpretation of the condition of the figure. In
the report of the trial which took place in the
reign of Ramses III of individuals accused of
a conspiracy against the life of the king it is
significantly said of some of those whose guilt
was established, “They died of themselves,”
and the suggestion has been made that this
figure, whose contortions might well be due to
the action of an irritant poison, is that of one
of these involuntary suicides. In either case,
the thing is sufficiently horrible, and hints, not
obscurely, at that darker aspect of Oriental
Court life which lay beneath all the glitter and
splendour of the Theban palace.</p>

<p>The find of Der el-Bahri was followed, in
1894–5, by the discoveries of M. de Morgan
at Dahshur, which have given us the exquisite
jewellery of the XIIth and XIIIth Dynasty
already alluded to in our chapter on the Pyramids.
And then, in 1898, M. Loret discovered in the
Valley of the Kings the tomb of Amenhotep II,
son of the great conqueror Thothmes III.</p>

<p>Until the great discovery of last year threw
all others into the shade, this discovery of M.
Loret was unique, for the mummy of Amenhotep
was found still resting in its coffin under the
gold-starred and blue-painted roof of the funerary
chamber—the first Pharaoh who had ever been
found sleeping in the tomb where he was laid.
His own records tell us of his prowess. “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
is a king very weighty of arm,” so the inscription
of the Amada and Elephantine steles runs;
“there is not one who can draw his bow among
his army, among the hill-country sheikhs, or
among the princes of Retenu, because his strength
is so much greater than that of any king who has
ever existed.” In later days this boast of the
old Pharaoh got twisted into the curious legend
which Herodotus records of the king of Ethiopia
who challenged Cambyses to draw his bow.
The redoubtable weapon itself, strange to say,
was found in the tomb along with its owner.
It bore the inscription: “Smiter of the Cave-dwellers,
overthrower of Kush, hacking up their
cities ... the great wall of Egypt, protector of
his soldiers.” Amenhotep was still wrapped in
his shroud and adorned with garlands; but the
tomb had been ruthlessly plundered in ancient
days, and little of artistic value was found. One
of the side-chambers of the tomb, however,
yielded a store of Pharaohs, only second in importance
to the great find of Der el-Bahri. Here
were gathered nine royal mummies, among
them those of Thothmes IV, Amenhotep III,
Siptah, Ramses IV, Ramses V, and Ramses VI.
Most interesting of all, in view of the idea then
prevalent of the date of the Exodus, was the
discovery, along with these, of the mummy of
Merenptah, who was held to be the Pharaoh of
the Exodus. The absence of Merenptah from
the royal gathering at Der el-Bahri was explained
by interested but casual readers of Scripture by
the fact that of course he was drowned in the
Red Sea. The narrative of Exodus, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
makes no such statement, and Merenptah duly
appeared, though the interest attaching to him
has somewhat waned with the progress of the
view that the Exodus took place two hundred
years before his reign.</p>

<p>The fate of the tomb of Amenhotep is suggestive
of the difficulties which meet the explorer
in his attempt to preserve for science and to treat
with proper reverence the relics of the past which
he unearths. The great king was left in his
coffin, with a few articles of his funerary furniture
beside him. The result was that in spite of the
armed guard which is maintained in the Valley
of the Kings, or perhaps with the complicity
of the guard, the tomb was rifled in 1901, the
mummy of the Pharaoh tumbled out on the
floor, and the model boat which had been left
beside the king stolen.</p>

<p>With the suggestion that Tutankhamen should
be allowed to rest in the midst of the splendours
which accompanied him to the grave, everyone
must sympathise; the question is, will he be
allowed to rest in peace, no matter what the
precautions which may be taken, in the midst
of a people with whom tomb-robbery is a
profession of six thousand years standing, and
who know the matchless value of the treasure
which lies within their reach? Whatever the
decision, it may be hoped that if the mummy of
the last king in the direct line of the great XVIIIth
Dynasty be found beneath his gorgeous canopy
it will not be made the subject of a vulgar show,
as is done with that of Amenhotep II.</p>

<p>In 1902 the work of excavation in the Valley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
of the Kings was undertaken by an American,
Mr. Theodore M. Davis, or rather the funds for
the work were provided by Mr. Davis, while
the actual work of excavation was carried on
by officials of the Service of Antiquities, first
Mr. Howard Carter, then Mr. Weigall, and Mr.
Ayrton. In 1903 Mr. Carter found the tomb of
Thothmes IV, son of Amenhotep II, and father
of Amenhotep III. His mummy had already
been found in the tomb of his father, but many
articles of funerary furniture, mostly broken,
were found, including the embossed leather
front of a state chariot, with decoration in gesso.
Between 1902 and 1912, the work financed by
Mr. Davis was crowned with the most astonishing
success. In these years were found the tombs of
Queen Hatshepsut, King Siptah, Akhenaten (or
rather the tomb of Queen Tiy, with the mummy
of Akhenaten), Horemheb, Prince Mentuherkhepshef,
and, above all, the tomb which, though
its occupants were not of royal rank, proved yet
the richest and the most interesting which was
ever discovered, till it was outclassed by that of
Tutankhamen—the tomb of Yuaa and Tuau.</p>

<p>It was in February, 1905, that the workmen
of Mr. Davis struck the first indication of the
tomb in the shape of a well-cut stone step, which
promised to prove the first of a flight descending
to a tomb-passage. By February 12 the door
was cleared, and the next day Mr. Davis, with
the late Sir Gaston Maspero and Mr. Weigall,
penetrated with some difficulty into the tomb-chamber,
and the little party found themselves
in the presence, not only of two of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
interesting personalities of Egyptian history, but
also of the most wonderful collection of funerary
furniture which, up to that time, had ever
rewarded the explorer. Their delight was very
nearly turned to tragedy before they had begun
to realise the importance of their find. In his
eagerness to inspect the funeral sledge, on which
Maspero had just read the famous name of Yuaa,
Mr. Davis stooped with his candle close to the
bitumen-covered woodwork, and was pulled back
just in time. One touch of the flame on the
pitch, and the corridors of the tomb would have
been a roaring tunnel of flame, in which Yuaa,
his funerary equipment, and his discoverers would
probably all have perished together.</p>

<p>The danger once realised, candles were
discarded, and electric light led into the tomb.
And then the explorers began to realise the full
wonder of their discovery. The tomb was full
of furniture of the finest and most careful workmanship.
Armchairs carved and inlaid, coffers
of wood inlaid and enamelled with that wonderful
blue of which the Egyptians had the secret,
boxes of painted wood, with figures in gilt gesso,
designed to hold the canopic jars which contain
the viscera of the dead, ushabti figures, some of
them plated with gold or silver, wicker-work
baskets for holding perfume bottles, couches of
elegant design, a perfectly preserved specimen
of the type of light chariot in which the Theban
noble of the Empire took his airing, cushions
stuffed with down, still soft and resilient after
three millenniums, costly alabaster vases, toilet
articles of all sorts, and a plentiful supply of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
mummified meats which the dead might require
for their journey through the Underworld; the
chamber was a storehouse of all that the Egyptian
deemed desirable for his use in this life or the
next. Nor were the needs of the spirit neglected.
There stood the magical figures by whose help
the occupants of the tomb were to make their
way through the dark paths of the Duat, inscribed
with the “Chapter of the Flame,” or the
“Chapter of the Magical Figure of the North
Wall”; while a great roll of papyrus 22 yards
long contained other prayers which would assist
the sleepers to conquer all the dangers of their
long road. Never had such an assemblage of
beautiful and curious things rewarded the seeker
even in this land of beautiful and curious things.</p>

<p>Fascinating as the treasures of the tomb
were, however, the main interest was not in them,
but in the two gilded coffins in which the owners
of all this wealth lay quietly sleeping their long
sleep. “First above Yuaa and then above his
wife the electric lamps were held, and as one
looked down into their quiet faces there was
almost the feeling that they would presently
open their eyes and blink at the light. The
stern features of the old man commanded one’s
attention, and again and again our gaze was
turned from this mass of wealth to this sleeping
figure in whose honour it had been placed there.”
For these two silent tenants of the tomb were
the man and woman to whose influence, in all
probability, was due not a little of that great
religious revolution which in a few years altered
the whole course of Egyptian history, and swayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the balance of the destinies of the Ancient East.
Prince Yuaa and his wife Tuau were the father
and mother of that famous Queen Tiy, whose sway
over the mind of her husband Amenhotep III
prepared the way for the supremacy of that
new spiritual faith of which her son, the ill-fated
Akhenaten, was in the fulness of time to be the
exponent and champion, and whose failure
broke his heart in the midst of the downfall of
the empire to which he had vainly attempted
to teach the creed of the Brotherhood of Man.
To few people has it been given to exercise so
great an influence upon the course of history as
to these two quiet figures whose rest was broken
after 3300 years by the representatives of three
nations whose ancestors were outer barbarians
when Prince Yuaa and his wife were foremost
figures in the most glittering court of the Ancient
East.</p>

<p>Two years later, the work of Mr. Davis
resulted in another discovery, less important
from the point of view of the wealth of funerary
furniture involved, for in this case there was
little found, but even more interesting in view
of the personality whose mummy occupied the
tomb. The site of the new find was at the
corner of the ravine leading to the well-known
tomb of Sety I, and was covered with gravel and
loose stones. “After some days of hard work,
the regular rectangle of a pit appeared upon the
soil, then two or three steps appeared, followed
by a staircase open to the sky, a door, a narrow
passage, and a wall of rock-work and beaten
earth. The seals affixed by the guardians, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
than thirty centuries before, were still intact on
the lime-wash.” Breaking them on January 6,
1907, Mr. Davis and Mr. Weigall penetrated
into a narrow passage, which was almost blocked
by two panels of gilded wood, which had once
formed part of a funeral canopy, like that of
Tutankhamen. Wriggling past these with
difficulty, they entered a roughly hewn and
quite undecorated chamber, on the floor of which
lay a few earthen pots, some alabaster ornaments,
and a number of amulets. But the sight which
arrested the eye was that of the coffin, which,
at the first glance, seemed in the glare of the
electric light to be made of massy gold. “It
seemed,” says Maspero, “as if all the gold of
ancient Egypt glittered and gleamed in that
narrow space.” The news of a wonderful discovery
of treasure spread far and wide through
the neighbourhood, growing as it spread, till
the report had reached such fabulous proportions
that it was necessary to place a guard over the
tomb to prevent an assault. Of course it was
more seeming than reality, for the gold turned
out to be mere gold-foil, and the tomb was in
reality singularly poor in objects of value. The
coffin had originally been placed upon a bier of
the usual form; but this had decayed, and the
heavy coffin had fallen, and its lid had come off
in the fall, exposing the head and feet of its
tenant, from which the bandages had decayed.
The body was wrapped in sheets of gold-foil,
and the inscription on the coffin, worked in semi-precious
stones, gave the title of Akhenaten,
“the beautiful child of the Sun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>Such a discovery was, of course, most
unexpected; for Akhenaten had made his capital,
not at Thebes, which he hated, but at Tell
el-Amarna, where he had declared his intention
to be buried, and where his tomb was known.
Besides, the inscription on the funeral canopy
stated that Akhenaten had made it for his mother
Queen Tiy. The explorers therefore concluded
that they had indeed discovered the tomb, part
of the funeral furniture, and the skeleton (it
cannot be called a mummy) of Queen Tiy, and
in this belief they sent the broken fragments of
the skeleton to Professor Elliot Smith for examination,
only to be informed by him that what
they had sent was not the body of an old woman,
but of a young man, who, if normal, which was
doubtful, could not have been much older than
twenty-six when he died. There seems in fact
to be little doubt that the skeleton which was
discovered in the tomb of Tiy was that of the
man whose action in one direction and inaction
in another changed the destiny of the ancient
world in one of the most critical periods of its
history. Mr. Davis, strange to say, could never
bear the idea that he had found the bones of
Akhenaten, though one would have thought
that the discovery of the most pathetic and
interesting figure of Egyptian history would have
put the crown on the satisfaction with which he
could justly regard his work. He had set his
heart on discovering Queen Tiy, and to have
even her far more famous son substituted for
her was a bitter disappointment to him.</p>

<p>But how came Akhenaten, the heretic king,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
“that criminal of Akhetaten,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> as the priests of
Amen always called him, to be buried, not in
his own heretic capital at Tell el-Amarna, but
in orthodox Thebes, and in his mother’s tomb?
There is, of course, no certain explanation of
the facts; but from what is known of the history
of the period an explanation may at least be
suggested with a reasonable amount of confidence
that it is not very far from the truth. When
Akhenaten died, his body was no doubt buried
at Tell el-Amarna, as he had decreed. When
his son-in-law, Tutankhaten, and his daughter,
Ankh. s. en. pa Aten, found the pressure of
circumstances too strong for them, and were
obliged to return to Thebes, to restore the old
religion, and to change their names to Tutankhamen
and Ankh. s. en. Amen, they carried with
them, doubtless, the body of the reformer, still
revered and beloved, and gave it honourable
burial in the tomb of Tiy—the most fitting place,
since no royal tomb could have been prepared
in Thebes. But as time went on, the reactionary
priests of Amen became more and more the
dominant element in the kingdom, and they had
none of the chivalrous spirit which prompted
Charles V’s “I war not with the dead,” at the
tomb of Luther. The only way in which they
could strike at the dead heretic was also, to an
Egyptian mind, the most certain and the most
deadly; they could destroy his hopes of immortality
by desecrating his tomb, and blotting out
his name from it. So the body of Queen Tiy
was removed from the tomb which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
polluted by the presence of her son, his name
was erased from the inscriptions, and the
entrance of the tomb was blocked with stones
and sealed with the seal of Tutankhamen. Then
the body of “the world’s first great idealist and
the world’s first <em>individual</em>” was left in solitude,
and, as his enemies fondly believed, in eternal
oblivion and shame, to await its resurrection,
thirty centuries later, at the hands of a generation
which has at least learned to appreciate and to
honour the ideals for which he sacrificed so much.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a> Akhetaten, the town created by Akhenaten, the man.</p>

</div>

<p>The remarkable success of Mr. Davis in the
search for buried royalties was fittingly crowned
a year later by the discovery of the tomb of
Horemheb, the usurping reactionary who had
formerly been a general in the service of Tutankhamen,
and who seized the throne after the
brief reigns of Tutankhamen and Ay. The tomb
had been plundered and wrecked, but the
beautiful red granite sarcophagus, 8 feet 11 inches
in length by 3 feet 9½ inches in width and 4 feet
in depth, was intact. In it were found the bones
of one person, but in such a condition that it was
impossible to determine the sex of the person
to whom they had belonged. In 1906 Mr.
Davis made another discovery, this time of an
uninscribed chamber nearly filled with mud.
The presence in the chamber and in the neighbourhood
of a number of articles bearing the
names of Tutankhamen and Ankh. s. en. Amen
led him to believe that this was the tomb of
Tutankhamen, and the sumptuous volume in
which he published the results of these last two
discoveries was therefore entitled “The Tombs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
of Harmhabi and Touatankhamanou.” Time
and further investigation have proved that in
this respect he was wrong, as also in the conviction
which he expressed in the book that
“the Valley of the Kings is now exhausted.”
Another discovery was due sixteen years after
his last find, which was to prove that the Valley
yet held treasures whose beauty and richness
could dazzle the world, and make even those of
the tomb of Yuaa seem almost paltry by comparison.
Yet the work of Mr. Davis remains
as one of the most remarkable series of successes
which has ever rewarded excavation in Egypt—a
fitting prelude to the great find of November,
1922.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Wonderful</span> as the results of the work
of Mr. Davis and his assistants had
been, they were destined to be
completely eclipsed by the most remarkable
discovery which has ever been made in all the long
story of Egyptological research. It may very
well prove in the long run that the importance
of the find historically is less than that of many
less striking discoveries; but as a revelation of
the sheer wealth and artistic quality of the provision
which was made three thousand years ago
for the journey through the Underworld of even a
comparatively obscure and unimportant Pharaoh,
there has never been anything to compare with
the discovery the news of which was flashed
across the world on November 30, 1922. “This
afternoon,” the message ran, “Lord Carnarvon
and Mr. Howard Carter revealed to a large
company what promises to be the most sensational
Egyptological discovery of the century.
The find consists of, among other objects, the
funeral paraphernalia of the Egyptian King
Tutankhamen, one of the famous heretic kings
of the XVIIIth Dynasty, who reverted to Amen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
worship.” It is not often that newspaper reports
err on the side of making too little of their subject;
but as the days and weeks passed on, and what
seemed to be an unending procession of marvels
defiled from the dark cave in the Valley of the
Kings before the astonished eyes of numberless
tourists, it became manifest that the half had not
been told, and that Egyptology was faced with a
wealth of material such as had never before been
dealt with, and such as will take many years to
appreciate and measure the full significance of.
All that can be attempted here is to give a
summary account of the find itself, and a brief
provisional account of some of the more important
of the treasures which have so far been disclosed;
for there can be no doubt that what has been
handled is but a fraction of the treasure which
still remains to be dealt with when the tomb is
reopened and the actual sarcophagus-chamber
and its annexe are cleared as the outer chambers
have been.</p>

<p>Some great Egyptological discoveries have
been the result of a mere happy chance, as was
the case in 1887, when a fellah woman, grubbing
for phosphates among the rubbish heaps of
Akhenaten’s ruined capital, found that store of
cuneiform tablets which have since become
world-famous as “The Tell el-Amarna Tablets,”
and disposed of her interest in the find to a friend
for the sum of two shillings. Some, as in the
case of the Der el-Bahri <em>cache</em>, have resulted
from the watch kept on the illegitimate practitioners
of research; and some, as in the case of
Belzoni’s discovery of the tomb of Sety I, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
been made with so little trouble that the wonder
is that they were not made long before. But
the discovery made by Lord Carnarvon and
Mr. Howard Carter fell into none of these
categories. It was the result of long and persistent
and systematic work, carried on under
very disappointing conditions, but with a clear
appreciation of the object in view. For sixteen
years the two explorers had been working together
at Thebes, and already in 1912, they had published
the results of their work in <cite>Five Years’ Exploration
at Thebes</cite>. Their work had not been
particularly fruitful, and when seven years ago
they took over the abandoned right to work in
the Valley of the Kings, their first efforts yielded
no very brilliant success. “Mostly disappointments,”
was Lord Carnarvon’s summary of his
previous finds. The explorers, however, were
proceeding on a plan which was bound to lead
to success in the end, if there was anything left
to be found, and if their patience, or their
resources, held out long enough in the face
of a continued monotony of failure. Previous
explorers, like Mr. Davis, had proceeded on the
method of <i lang="fr">sondages</i>, or trial pits, sinking a pit
here and another there in spots which they
judged likely. Such a method, obviously, may
lead to success very simply and easily; or, on
the other hand, it may result in your missing the
very spot where the treasure lies. The method
adopted by Lord Carnarvon and Mr. Carter
was much more thorough, though also much more
laborious and monotonous. They systematically
cleared the ground over a selected area down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
the virgin rock. The labour involved in such a
method of work is, of course, enormous; it is
said that the two explorers moved 200,000 tons
of rubbish in their researches; but it is plain
that there is no chance of missing your object
by a foot or two, as is quite possible with the other
plan. There may, of course, be nothing in your
area at all; but if there is anything, you are
bound to get it.</p>

<p>So it proved at last in this case. On the fifth
of November, Mr. Carter, who was working on a
spot which so far had been untouched because
it lay in front of the tomb of Ramses VI, which
is one of the regular electrically lighted show-tombs
of the Valley, came upon a rock-cut step,
which seemed like the beginning of a flight
leading to a tomb. He cleared a few more steps,
and then came to a door, or rather to a cement-covered
wall, blocking a doorway. On the
cement of the wall was visible the seal of the
royal portion of the Theban necropolis, consisting
of a jackal couchant above nine captives in rows
of three. When the excavation had reached
this stage, Mr. Carter cabled to Lord Carnarvon
to come out to Egypt at once, as a fine discovery
had been made, and the spot was covered up
till his arrival.</p>

<p>The resumption of the excavation showed
that in ancient days a thief had broken into the
tomb, which had been inspected and sealed by
the inspectors of Ramses IX subsequent to his
entrance. On the undamaged portion of the
wall there could be seen the cartouche of the
Pharaoh Tutankhamen, son-in-law and successor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
to the famous Akhenaten. After arrangements
had been made for protecting the tomb and
whatever it might contain from the efforts of
the modern successors of the Ramesside thief,
the entrance passage, about 8 metres long, was
cleared, and another sealed door was reached.
It was uncertain whether the explorers would
find another staircase or passage behind this new
obstacle, or whether it would give access to one
of the chambers of the tomb. What followed
may best be told in the words of Lord Carnarvon
himself:</p>

<p>“I asked Mr. Carter to take out a few stones
and have a look in. After a few minutes this
was done. He pushed his head partly into the
aperture. With the help of a candle he could
dimly discern what was inside. A long silence
followed, till I said, I fear in somewhat trembling
tones, ‘Well, what is it?’ ‘There are some
wonderful objects here,’ was the welcome reply.
Having given up my place to my daughter, I
myself went to the hole, and I could with difficulty
restrain my excitement. At the first sight,
with the inadequate light, all that one could
see was what appeared to be gold bars. On
getting a little more accustomed to the light it
became apparent that there were colossal gilt
couches with extraordinary heads, boxes here
and boxes there. We enlarged the hole, and
Mr. Carter managed to scramble in—the chamber
is sunk 2 feet below the bottom of the passage—and
then, as he moved around with a candle, we
knew that we had found something absolutely
unique and unprecedented. Even with the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
light of the candle one could see a marvellous
collection of furniture and other objects in the
chamber. There were two life-sized statues of
the king, beds, chariots, boxes of all sizes and
shapes—some with every sort of inlay, while
others were painted—walking sticks, marvellous
alabaster vases, and so on. After slightly
enlarging the hole we went in, and this time we
realised in a fuller degree the extent of the
discovery, for we had managed to tap the electric
light from the tomb above, which gave us far
better illumination for our examination.”</p>

<p>Inspection quickly proved that the first
revelation was only the beginning of marvels.
Beneath one of the state couches a small opening
in the wall of the chamber showed where a
second chamber opened off the first. This room
it was impossible even to enter, for it was crammed
to a height of 5 feet with articles of furniture
of all descriptions, packed close together in
seemingly inextricable confusion. At the one
end of the first chamber stood two life-sized
statues of the king in bituminised wood with gold
adornments, and between them was the evidence
that other chambers lay beyond; for this
part of the room had been closed with a wall
on which the seals of the Ramesside inspectors
could still be seen, and in the centre of this wall,
on the floor level, there were traces of the fact
that a break had once been made in the wall,
sufficiently large to admit a small man. This had
subsequently been sealed up again, probably
by the inspectors of Ramses IX.</p>

<p>Manifestly there was more to follow behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
that sealed wall. In the two chambers which
had been seen there was no trace of any sarcophagus,
or any evidence whatever of any
interment. It was obvious, therefore, that, unless
this wonderful mass of artistic craftsmanship was
only a <em>cache</em> where robbers’ loot was gathered,
or a gathering of costly material drawn together
for safety from robbers, both of which alternatives
seemed somewhat unlikely, the real tomb-chamber,
with what was in all probability the
unimaginable wealth of the great nest of coffins
under its canopy, the coffers for the canopic
vases, and all the other funerary regalia of a
Pharaoh of the Empire, lay beyond the wall which
closed the end of the first chamber. In that case,
the revelations which awaited the explorers might
well be of a kind which would make even the
glories which had so far been disclosed look dim
and paltry. The explorers must have been sorely
tempted to pierce the wall at once, and so arrive
at least at some conception of the magnitude of
their find; but prudence forbade this. The
amount of material already under their hands in
the outer chambers was sufficient to occupy all
the time of the experts who had gathered to the
scene for many weeks. The fabrics concerned
were all of them priceless, and some of them were
of almost inconceivable delicacy. All of them
were at least three thousand years old, and had
during all that time been shut up in the still air
of a subterranean vault. Until they had been
carefully treated with preservatives, and insured,
so far as possible, from the risks of exposure to
the air and the heat of the upper world, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
impossible to do anything that would add to the
task, already one of great labour and difficulty,
which lay upon the explorers and their assistants.
Accordingly curiosity was kept in check until the
results of the first discovery should be secured,
and the opening of what was hoped would prove
the first intact royal tomb-chamber ever found
in Egypt was deferred for awhile. Meanwhile
for weeks the Valley of the Kings was beset, day
after day, by throngs of tourists before whose
astonished eyes there passed a seemingly endless
procession of the marvels of ancient Egyptian
craftsmanship of thirty centuries ago, and who
seemed to take it as a personal grievance when
the articles removed on any particular day were
not sufficiently numerous or gorgeous to satisfy
their craving for sensation. Tutankhamen
became the fashion, and leaped at once into
greater prominence than he ever enjoyed during
his short and not particularly glorious reign.</p>

<p>When the contents of the outer chamber had
been placed in safety, the time came for the
breaking of the sealed wall which barred the sarcophagus-chamber
from view; and on February 16
this was at last accomplished in the presence
of a distinguished company of Egyptologists,
though the formal opening, at which the Queen
of the Belgians was present, did not take place
till two days later. When it was possible to
see through the growing aperture into the inner
chamber, the sight revealed was one to take
the breath away from the most hardened
treasure-hunter. Practically the whole chamber
was filled, from end to end, and side to side, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
an object which no man has seen intact for more
than three millenniums—the funerary canopy
or shrine of an Egyptian Pharaoh of the New
Empire, beneath which, it might be hoped, lay
the successive coffins, with all their wealth of
amulets and ushabtis, which guarded the mummy
of the dead king. The canopy itself was of the
most extraordinary beauty and splendour. It
was of wood heavily gilded, carved with representations
of the Buckle of Isis and the Pillar of
Osiris, and inlaid with panels of that exquisite
blue glaze of which the Egyptians were so justly
fond. Its upper edge was formed by the familiar
Egyptian gorge-cornice, and its roof was of the
usual coved type, common in shrines of all sorts.
So completely did it fill the chamber, that there
was scarcely room to pass between it and the
rock walls, which were rather poorly decorated
with painted figures. On the east side of the
canopy were bronze-hinged doors, and when
these were opened, there appeared within a
second canopy, entirely gilt, and closed with doors
on which the seals, with their strings, were
perfectly intact, a fact of great importance, since
it signifies that in all probability the inner shrine
remains absolutely as it was left on the day when
the Pharaoh was laid to rest amidst all his
splendours. Between the two canopies there
lay alabaster vessels, amulets, scarabs of rare
colour and fine material, and precious stones.
Between the outer canopy and the wall of the
chamber lay the paddles for the king’s barge on
the waters of the Underworld.</p>

<p>On the same side of the sarcophagus-chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
as the doors of the shrine, a large opening in
the wall, which had never been closed, led into
an annexe. On guard near the entrance of this
room was an ebony and gold figure of the god
Anubis as a jackal couchant on the top of his
shrine. Perhaps the most conspicuous thing in
the room was a great gilt coffer, standing over
5 feet high, and adorned along the top with
golden uræi, which in all likelihood is the shrine
containing the Canopic Jars in which the viscera
of the royal mummy were deposited. On its
four sides were figures of guardian goddesses,
enfolding the shrine with their arms, and wrought
with the most wonderful delicacy of modelling
and realism of expression. They seemed, said
one observer, to be turning reproachful faces
towards the intruders who were disturbing the
long peace of the tomb. The whole room was
crowded with objects of all sorts, coffers and
boxes of splendid material and workmanship,
model boats for the king’s use in the Elysian
Fields, ushabti figures in gold and silver, and one
exquisite and unique specimen, absolutely complete,
of the ostrich-feather fans which are so
often depicted on the reliefs of royal processions.
The handle of this beautiful piece of craftsmanship
was of ivory, delicately carved and adorned
with the royal cartouche inlaid in coloured stones.</p>

<p>Such was something of the general impression
which was left on the minds of the fortunate few
who were privileged to be present at the most
marvellous disclosure of the wealth and artistry
of ancient Egypt which has ever been given to
the world. The impression was of the briefest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
for the explorers had reluctantly to come to
the conclusion that it was impossible to carry
the work further this season. The heat of the
Egyptian spring in the sun-scorched valley was
already growing almost unbearable; the amount
of precious material already collected was such
as would require months for its proper preservation
and arrangement, and it was impossible to
add to it a far greater quantity of still more priceless
treasure without risking loss and damage.
Accordingly, after the tomb had been kept open
for a few days longer, it was decided to close it
again until the autumn, when the conditions for
work would be more favourable. The gang of
workmen was set to work again, and by the end
of February the tomb of Tutankhamen was once
more piled with many hundred tons of rubbish,
and the king was left beneath his gorgeous
canopy to enjoy for a few months longer the sleep
which had been unbroken for 3300 years.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the incident did not close
without an event which seemed to cast a dark
shadow across all the splendour of the discovery.
Almost immediately after the triumph of the
opening, and before the freshness of its interest
had faded from men’s minds, Lord Carnarvon
was stricken down with fever, and in the beginning
of April he died in Cairo, leaving his great
work still incomplete. There is no need to talk
of the flood of superstitious drivel which was let
loose over the world by what seemed so tragic
an ending to so great a success. It is hard to
say whether stupidity or cruelty were more
conspicuous in it, and it remains self-condemned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
in the eyes of all reasonable people. There is,
no doubt, an element of sadness in the thought
that he without whom these treasures of the past
might never have been disclosed did not live to
see the completion of his work; but there is
surely also an element of satisfaction in the
thought that he knew that his long toil had not
been in vain, and that he had accomplished
something unique in the story of the exploration
of that ancient world to which we owe so much.
To leave the scene of triumph while the splendour
of accomplishment is still undimmed has ever
been esteemed the happiest of destinies. If it be
so, then Lord Carnarvon was <i lang="la">felix opportunitate
mortis</i>.</p>

<p>Before we turn to the consideration of some
of the chief treasures which have so far been
gathered from the outer chambers of the tomb,
let us devote a moment to the question of who
the Pharaoh is whose splendours have thus
dazzled the world, and what is known of his
reign and his times. Not the least remarkable
feature of the whole find is that the man around
whom all this magnificence was gathered is just
about one of the last of the Pharaohs whom one
would have suspected of creating a sensation in
the world of Egyptology. His reign is one of the
shortest and least fully recorded in the roll of
the XVIIIth Dynasty; indeed the only kings
of the Dynasty who seem yet more insignificant
than himself are his immediate predecessor
Smenkhara, and his immediate successor Ay.
The circumstances of his reign, so far as they are
known, are briefly these. Tutankhamen began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
his career as one of the courtiers of Amenhotep
IV (Akhenaten), and one of his supporters
in the great revolution which he attempted to
carry out on the religion of Egypt; though, from
his apparent youth at the time of his death, he
can scarcely have had any real share in the
movement. Whether he was of the blood royal
or not is uncertain. On the lion from Gebel
Barkal, now in the British Museum, he calls
Amenhotep III his father. If this means direct
relationship, then he must have been the son of
Amenhotep III by a secondary wife, and in that
case he was a half-brother of Akhenaten, whose
son-in-law he afterwards became. On the other
hand, the title may be only one of respect applied
to an indirect ancestor—really his grandfather-in-law.
In any case he must have been of such
noble rank, and of a family of such influence,
that it was worth Akhenaten’s while to secure his
adhesion to the new cause, even when he was no
more than a boy, by marrying him to one of the
young princesses. Accordingly he was married
to the third of Akhenaten’s daughters, the
princess Ankh. s. en. pa. aten, the first daughter,
Meryt-aten, being married to another noble of
the court, Smenkhara, and the second, Makt-aten,
having died probably between her ninth and
eleventh year; and at this time, and till after his
accession to the throne, he bears the name
Tutankhaten, the name of Amen being of course
proscribed by the new faith.</p>

<p>On the death of Akhenaten without male
issue, Smenkhara, the husband of the eldest
princess, naturally, according to Egyptian custom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
succeeded to the throne, and reigned for a short
and uncertain period; then on his death or
deposition, the succession fell to Tutankhaten.
For a time, apparently, he maintained himself
in the new capital of Akhetaten (Tell el-Amarna),
but the reaction in favour of the old faith of
Amen proved too strong for him, and he was
obliged to remove the court to Thebes, and to
conform to the worship of Amen. His name was
changed to Tutankhamen (Living Image of
Amen), and that of his wife to Ankh. s. en. Amen
(Her Life is from Amen), and every trace of the
religious revolution was obliterated so far as
possible. The duration of his reign is uncertain,
and probably it cannot have been longer than
nine years. It has been suggested, from the
evidence of some of the articles in his tomb,
that he died before attaining maturity—at all
events he must have been still a young man at the
time of his death.</p>

<p>As to the events of his reign, we are much in
the dark. The brilliance of his funerary equipment
has led to the rather hasty conclusion that
the reign was marked by a great renaissance of
Egyptian art and power, and an attempt to regain
the Empire which had been largely lost during
the pacifist reign of Akhenaten; but this theory
rests on very slight foundations, and, as we shall
see, there is another and much more likely
explanation of the splendour of the tomb. The
only evidences of foreign enterprise during the
reign are found in the inscriptions in the tombs
of two of the great nobles of the period, Huy
and Horemheb, the latter of whom usurped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
throne after the death or deposition of Tutankhamen’s
successor, Ay. In the tomb of Huy
there are records of tribute from Syria and
the Soudan, so that it is evident that Egyptian
influence was not altogether gone in these two
quarters; and one of the statements in the tomb
of Horemheb seems to point to military operations
in Syria under Tutankhamen. In this
inscription, from a fragment in the Cairo
Museum, Horemheb describes himself as “King’s
follower on his expeditions in the south and north
country,” and “Companion of the feet of his
lord upon the battlefield on that day of slaying
the Asiatics.”</p>

<p>Beyond this, there is really no evidence as to
any events of importance during the reign,
whose significance is not in itself, but in the fact
that it marks the triumph of the forces of reaction
and the reversion to the ancient customs and faith
of the land. The early death of Tutankhamen
left his wife, Ankh. s. en. Amen, in a very difficult
position. She was the only representative in
the direct line of the great XVIIIth Dynasty;
but in all probability her own tenure of the throne
was very uncertain, and almost impossible.</p>

<p>For a woman to rule the land was a thing not
unheard of, for Hatshepsut had ruled with
vigour and success; but it was an unusual thing,
though a woman could give to her husband a
legitimate title to the royal dignity. Further,
there was a point which rendered the reign of
Ankh. s. en. Amen virtually an impossibility. She
was deeply stained, in the eyes of the dominant
priesthood of Amen, by the fact that she was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
daughter of “that criminal of Akhetaten,” as
her father was now called. Her husband had
saved his throne, and probably his life, by his
conformity to the old faith, and her conversion
had accompanied his; but the daughter of
Akhenaten can never have been <i lang="la">persona grata</i> to
the priests of Amen, and when her husband was
gone she must have felt that her tenure of the
crown, and her very life, hung by a very frail
thread. Accordingly she took steps to place
herself in a position of greater security.
Curiously enough, there has come to light from
Boghaz-Kyoi, the Hittite capital, a letter from one
of the Hittite kings, probably Mursil II, telling
of some of the events of the reign of his father
Shubbiluliuma, which gives us our last glimpse
of the poor widowed queen struggling in desperation
to escape from the net of deadly danger which
was drawing closer and closer around her.</p>

<figure id="il_24" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">

</figure>

<p>“Then their ruler,” says the Hittite king,
“namely Bib-khuru-riyas [the Hittite version of
Neb. kheperu-Ra, the Solar name of Tutankhamen],
just at that moment died; now the Queen
of Egypt was Dakhamun [the Hittite version of
Ankh. s. en. Amen]. She sent an ambassador to
my father; she said thus to him: ‘My husband
is dead; I have no children; your sons are said
to be grown up; if to me one of your sons you
will give, and if he will be my husband, he will
be a help; send him accordingly, and thereafter
I will make him my husband. I send bridal
gifts.’” The negotiations thus frankly opened
by the queen apparently proceeded, not without
some hitches, to the point when the bridegroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
was selected from among the Hittite princes;
for Mursil’s statement closes thus: “And then
the lady soon fulfilled her words and selected one
of the sons.” Something, however, must have
hindered the completion of the marriage. What
it was we may guess, but with no assurance that
we are right. The Hittites were old enemies of
Egypt, and while Ramses II, a century later,
might safely wed a Hittite princess, it was quite
another thing for a woman, very insecurely
established on the throne, to propose to give
Egypt a Hittite king. In itself the plan was
likely to be most unpopular with poor Ankh. s. en.
Amen’s subjects. Even more fatal to it would
be the opposition of the priesthood. They, no
doubt, had no desire to see the line of their
great enemy established on the throne with a new
lease of power, and backed by the might of the
formidable Hittite Confederacy. It would be
an easy thing for them to play on the native
prejudice against the attempt to bring in a Hittite
consort for their queen. The probability is
that the very step which Ankh. s. en. Amen took
to secure herself actually hastened, or at least
made inevitable, her downfall. At all events
the unlucky young widow disappears, with this
letter, from the page of history; nor is it difficult
to imagine the manner of her disappearance.
The journey from the palace to the tomb has
never been a long one for an unpopular sovereign
in the East, whether in ancient or modern days.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the story of Tutankhamen’s
reign, so far as we know it. It may be that when
all the secrets of his tomb are disclosed we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
learn a little more of the man and his times,
though that is rather more than unlikely, for the
papyri which may be found in the great shrine of
the sarcophagus-chamber will probably be, not
historical, but purely religious. Meantime, at all
events, we know no more, and the little that is
known only seems to underline the contrast
between the insignificance of the king and the
splendour of the tomb which has dazzled all the
world. The pathos of the whole thing can
scarcely fail to appeal to the imagination. Here
you have a dead monarch laid to rest with such
pomp and magnificence that a mere glimpse of
the glitter of his equipment has left the world
bewildered and gaping; and when you try to
conceive the actual facts of the lives behind all
this gorgeousness, what you dimly discern, so
far as you can see anything, is a poor young
couple of children, for Tutankhamen and his
wife were scarcely more than that, striving for
a little to keep their heads above the dark flood
of poisonous priestly hatred and intrigue which
surged around them on every side, and sinking
one after the other beneath their doom.</p>

<p>Obviously the time has not yet come for the
discussion of the results of the discovery as these
affect our ideas of Egyptian art and craftsmanship.
It will be many months, perhaps years, before
all the material is before the world in the shape of
colour reproductions of the various articles, and
until this work is completed comparisons with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
already known work cannot be made. Much
that has been said with regard to the revolution
in our ideas of Egyptian art which is to be
brought about by the revelations of Tutankhamen’s
tomb may have to be qualified or withdrawn
in the light of fuller and more leisurely
study, and certain things which were for the
moment acclaimed as masterpieces will beyond
doubt be deposed from an eminence which they
would never have attained save under the
influence of the enthusiasm of the moment.
Still, even when all deductions have been made,
there will remain an amount of material of the
very highest quality, such as has never before
been gathered together for the study of one of
the most interesting periods of Egyptian history
and art.</p>

<p>Already it is manifest that some of the articles
are quite without parallel in any existing collection
of Egyptian antiquities. Parallels to most
of them, probably to all, doubtless existed, and
we can well imagine that even the finest things
may have been far surpassed by the magnificence
of a really great Pharaoh, such as Amenhotep III;
but these splendours of the culminating period of
the Empire no longer exist, or at least have not
yet come to light, and we were obliged to form
our conception of them from reliefs and paintings,
and to fill in the details of their magnificence from
our knowledge of the grandeur of the monarch
for whose use they were made. Now for the
first time we can see the actual creations themselves,
and even if they belong, not to one of the
greatest of the Pharaohs, but to a comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
undistinguished monarch, still they represent
the art of a period not far removed from the
historic culmination of Egypt’s greatness, and
it is quite within the bounds of possibility, as
we shall see, that some of the most striking
of them do indeed belong to the greater age
of Tutankhamen’s ancestors, rather than to
his own.</p>

<p>Of all the articles so far removed from the
tomb, the one which has attracted the most
attention, and excited the most admiration, has
been the Royal Throne, or Chair of State, which
was found in the outer chamber. “It is one of
the wonders of the world,” was the comment of
Professor Breasted on his first view of it, and
there seems to be little doubt that this enthusiastic
praise is well deserved. Within the last quarter
of a century, two of the royal thrones of two of
the greatest empires of the ancient world have
been brought to light, and the simple dignity of
the Throne of Minos, discovered by Sir Arthur
Evans in the Palace of Knossos, forms a most
effective contrast and foil to the gorgeousness of
the Throne of Tutankhamen of Thebes, from
which it may be separated in date by not much
more than a century, the Cretan throne being the
earlier, and indeed the earliest royal throne known
to exist.</p>

<p>The Throne of Tutankhamen is of wood,
covered with a thin plating of gold and adorned
with finely carved lions’ heads. The arms of the
chair are of modelled wood also overlaid with
gold, and beneath them, on either side, is a
sacred uræus, partly wrought in glaze, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
crown of Egypt in silver. On the back of the
throne is a panel of beautiful workmanship, on
which the king is represented seated, with his
legs crossed, and giving his hand to the Queen,
who is standing—a motive which in its unconventionality
speaks distinctly of the realistic
art of Tell el-Amarna, and suggests comparisons
with the famous Berlin relief in which Akhenaten
leans on his staff, while his Queen Nefertiti
holds out a lotus bloom for him to sniff. The
exposed flesh of the faces and other parts of the
body is beautifully modelled in semi-opaque
reddish glaze, while the King’s costume is
rendered in painting overlaid with crystal. The
queen’s dress is wrought in silver, and beside her,
on a table, there stands a charming bouquet
formed of semi-precious stones inlaid. The seat
of the throne is patterned with blue, white, and
gold mosaic squares, set in diagonal lines. The
whole effect is gorgeous in the extreme, and the
description of the workmanship takes one’s mind
back at once to the King’s Gaming Board of the
Palace of Knossos, with its blaze of blue and gold
and crystal on ivory. Whether we are to infer
Cretan influence in the Egyptian splendour, or
whether Crete derived from earlier Egyptian
work, is a question which may prove of interest
in the future. At any rate, we know that the
two great cultures were for many centuries in
the closest touch, and that each borrowed from
the other, adapting the foreign ideas to its own
tastes.</p>

<p>One of the features of the throne is highly
suggestive of the conditions of Tutankhamen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
reign. On the gold plating of the chair, the royal
cartouche has been altered, and shows the name
which the king adopted after his conversion to
orthodoxy. At the side of the arms, however,
the cartouche, wrought in inlay of semi-precious
stones and glass, remains unaltered, and still
shows the old heretical form Tutankhaten. The
manifest reason for the difference is that while
it was comparatively easy to alter a cartouche
wrought in gold plate, it was very much the
opposite with one wrought in inlay. Tutankhamen,
spite of his royal dignity, had, like
Mrs. Gilpin, a frugal mind, and could see no
sense in discarding his old Tell el-Amarna
throne, even though it could not be perfectly
adapted to his change of circumstances and of
faith.</p>

<p>So the throne survives to tell us, not only of
the wonderful artistic skill of the Egyptian craftsman
of 3300 years ago, but also of the difficulties
and inconsistencies of such a period of transition
as that in which Tutankhamen’s lot was cast.
On the stele which he set up at Karnak, and which
is now in the Cairo Museum, the king has
described the miserable state of the kingdom on
his accession. “When His Majesty became
King of the South, the whole country was in a
state of chaos, similar to that in which it had been
in primeval times. From Elephantine to the
Swamps of the Delta the properties of the
temples of the gods and goddesses had been
destroyed, their shrines were in a state of ruin,
and their estates had become a desert. Weeds
grew in the courts of the temples.” He tells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
us of the wonders of restoration which he
accomplished when “Egypt and the Red Land
came under his supervision, and every land
greeted his will with bowings of submission.”</p>

<p>But Horemheb’s Coronation Inscription suggests
a somewhat different state of affairs from
the picture of restored prosperity which Tutankhamen
presents, and the hatred with which the
later monarch pursued the memory of his
predecessor hints that the reign of the half-heretic
king was but reluctantly accepted, as a
stage on the way to the full restoration of the
ancient state of affairs—a stage whose fitting
emblem is the throne with its symbols of the old
faith and the new intermingled.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting among the finds
of the outer chamber is that of the boxes containing
royal robes, both of the King and the
Queen. Whether it may be found possible
to preserve permanently these exquisitely dainty
fabrics remains to be seen; meanwhile it may
be said that what has been seen of them enhances
our respect for the skill of the weavers of the
XVIIIth Dynasty who wrought such superlatively
fine stuffs. Incidentally, the Queen’s
robes give us a curious link with the Egypt of a
day far earlier than even that of Tutankhamen.</p>

<p>In the Westcar Papyrus we are told how King
Seneferu, the last king of the IIIrd Dynasty,
about seventeen hundred years before the time of
Tutankhamen, feeling bored one day, called to
him the wizard Zazamankh, and demanded a
cure for his ennui, and how the wizard prescribed
a sail in the royal barge manned by twenty of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
most beautiful maidens of the royal harem.
“Bring me twenty oars of ebony inlaid with
gold, with blades of light wood, inlaid with
electrum; and bring me twenty maidens, fair
in their limbs, their bosoms and their hair, all
virgins; and bring me twenty fishing-nets, and
give these nets unto the maidens for their
garments.” Now the Queen’s robes, found in
the tomb, “are made of the daintiest diaphanous
bead net material.” Evidently the taste which
inspired the novel prescription of the IIIrd
Dynasty wizard persisted in the Egyptian Court.
We should have inferred as much from the reliefs
and paintings which have come down to us, but
the robes from the Tutankhamen tomb are the
solitary specimens of the royal dress of ancient
Egypt which have survived to the present day.</p>

</figure>

<p>Along with these robes may be grouped the
so-called coat of mail, which is one of the wonders
of the ceremonial art of the time. The general
type of this wonderful garment is familiar from
Wilkinson’s representation of the corselet pictured
in the tomb of Ramses III, with its overlapping
scales of metal. In the case of Tutankhamen’s
corselet, however, the scales, instead of being
of bronze on leather, are pear-shaped links of
faience laid on gold and backed with linen,
which, of course, has almost entirely perished,
rendering the reconstitution of the coat a
matter of great difficulty. The collar shows a
rich pattern of concentric rings and rectangular
plaques of faience in deep turquoise blue, and
red and yellow. Below the collar, and wrought
into the breast of this superb piece of mail, is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
brilliant design stretching right across the chest,
representing the hawk-headed Horus introducing
Tutankhamen to Amen. Should it be possible
to complete the restoration of this beautiful
piece of design, we shall be in possession of a
unique specimen of the Egyptian armourer’s
art, though, of course, it is such a piece of
armour as was never destined to be worn on
active service, but only on ceremonial occasions.
Indeed, it is probable that the ceremonial
occasion for which it was designed was that of
the King’s funeral; for we know from the
Rainer Papyrus that such corselets formed, at
least in later days, an essential portion of the
royal funerary furnishing—so much so that the
funeral could not be completed without them.</p>

<p>Between six and seven hundred years after
the time of Tutankhamen, the funeral of Eiorhoreru,
prince of Heliopolis, could not be
completed because Ka. amenhotep, prince of
Mendes, had stolen his funerary breastplate.
Pimay, the son of the dead prince, has to win the
corselet back in a tournament before he can get
his father buried with the proper ceremonies. A
matter of seven hundred years is nothing in the
life of an Egyptian custom; and there can be
little doubt that the corselet of Tutankhamen is
just such a ceremonial breastplate as that for whose
possession Pimay and his allies fought in tourney
against Ka. amenhotep and his friends, with
Pedubast of Tanis, overlord of the Delta, as
judge of the passage of arms.</p>

<p>Among the other articles of royal wearing
apparel were the magnificent sandals with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
decoration of golden ducks’ heads and gold
roundels. The leather of the sandals had almost
entirely perished with the lapse of time, being
turned into a substance more like glue; but it
retained sufficient tenacity to hold the decorative
work together, and to let us see how magnificently
a Pharaoh of the Empire was shod and how
gorgeous were the feet before which the vassal
kings of Syria and the Soudan bowed down,
“seven times and seven times.” Interesting
too, in their own way, were the child’s linen
glove, and the child’s tippet, of linen with sequin
decoration. Speculation has framed, on the
basis of the small size of these and other articles,
the theory that the king died in early youth, in
fact when he had scarcely emerged from childhood.
We know nothing, however, of the reason
for the presence of these articles in the tomb;
and the foundation for such speculations is
far too slight to bear the weight of inference
which it is sought to rear upon it. From other
and more satisfactory reasons it has been inferred
that Tutankhamen died in early maturity; but
that is a different matter.</p>

<p>Nothing is more fitted to reconcile us to the
destiny which has decreed that we should live
in the drab and unpicturesque twentieth century
than the contemplation of the inconveniences
with which the kings and great folk of the bygone
ages had to put up in the midst of the glittering
splendours which dazzle our imagination. One
of these is hinted at by the presence in the tomb
of the candlesticks which bore the light of
Tutankhamen’s days. They are small bronze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
articles, shaped in the form of the Ankh, and
carrying fastened to them linen wicks, which were,
no doubt, soaked in oil. As small pieces of
decorative workmanship, they are pretty enough;
but it is impossible to imagine anything much
less satisfactory in the way of lighting than they
would seem to be. No doubt there were other
and bigger candlesticks than these, and we cannot
imagine that a luxurious court like that of Thebes
would not have something corresponding to the
great stone standard lamps which flared and
sputtered in the halls and corridors of the
contemporary palace of Minos at Knossos; but
even so, the lighting of an Egyptian palace must
have been what we should think miserably
inefficient, and Pharaoh must have been sorely
put to it to find occupation for his evenings, when
all the glitter of his gorgeousness grew dim and
shabby in the light of the miserable smoking and
flickering lamps which at best can have done
little more than to make darkness visible.</p>

<p>A prominent feature among the heaps of
wonderful things in the tomb was the group
of elaborately carved alabaster vases which has
been so often figured and so much be-praised
since the discovery was made. Of the interest
attaching to these extraordinary vases there
can be no question; but when we are told that
they are “the most beautiful alabaster vases in
the world,” it is time to enter a protest. They
are nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>As specimens of workmanship they are
wonderful enough; as specimens of art they are
flagrantly bad,—characteristic types of an art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
which has passed its maturity and is on the
downgrade. The over-elaboration and the far
too complicated character of their decoration
are sufficient to condemn them, and they are not
to be compared for one moment, from the point
of artistic value, with the simple and graceful
forms of earlier work. Indeed, even in Tutankhamen’s
tomb, and in the same chamber with
these over-praised and overdone pieces of pretentiousness,
there were vases far more worthy
of praise for their artistic quality than the ones
whose noisy ornamentation has singled them
out for a notice which they do not deserve.</p>

<p>Of all the objects so far removed from the
tomb, none has attracted more attention, and
none seems likely to create more controversy,
than the group of extraordinary gilt state couches,
the Lion, Hathor, and Typhon couches, as they
came to be called. The thing which drew attention
to them was not their beauty, for anything
more hideous it is impossible to imagine; it was
their strangeness. With Egyptian couches and
biers the world was pretty familiar before; but
these were widely different, with their quiet and
shapely lines, from the barbaric monstrosities
of Tutankhamen’s tomb. The heads of the
couches present, indeed, some resemblances to
familiar Egyptian types; but even so, the suggestion
which rises to the mind on viewing them is
that these are Egyptian types interpreted by an
alien temperament and executed by alien craftsmen.
It seems almost impossible to believe
that an Egyptian craftsman, with his tradition of
taste and restraint, would ever have produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
such abortions, calculated to produce nightmares
instead of slumber in those who tried to rest
upon them.</p>

<p>Accordingly Professor Petrie has asserted that
these couches are not of Egyptian workmanship
at all. No Egyptian workman, he says, ever
produced work assembled with bronze joints as
these couches are; they must have been produced
in a distant country, and jointed in this fashion
for convenience of transport, being reassembled
on their arrival. Further, the decoration (trefoil)
on one of them is characteristically Babylonian.
Therefore it seems probable that we must look
to Babylon for their origin; and Professor
Petrie suggests that these are the identical couches
to which the Babylonian king Kadashman-Enlil
refers in one of the Tell el-Amarna letters, where
he says, writing to Amenhotep III, that he is
sending to the Egyptian king “a couch of <em>ushu</em>
wood, ivory and gold, three couches and six
thrones of <em>ushu</em> and gold,” and other furniture.</p>

<p>There is nothing unlikely in the idea that
couches of such international importance, coming
from one great monarch to another, should have
been preserved for the matter of forty years
or so, and buried as heirlooms in the tomb of
the last of the line; and the suggestion lends
an added interest to the ugly things. Sir
E.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;W. Budge, however, rejects the idea, and
asserts that the beast represented on the most
hideous of the couches is simply the composite
monster Ammit, “the Eater of the Dead,” so
often represented in the Judgment Scene in the
vignettes of the <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Mesopotamians knew of no such beast, and the
couch or bier could only have been made in
Egypt, where the existence of Ammit was
believed in and the fear of her was great.” In
support of his opinion he quotes from the
Papyrus of Hunefer—“Her forepart is crocodile,”
and anyone familiar with the Judgment Scene
will remember that this certainly is so. The
trouble is that whatever the hideous monster
of Tutankhamen’s tomb may represent, “her
forepart” certainly is <em>not</em> crocodile. It is ugly
and sinister enough for anything; but no
Egyptian craftsman would have dreamed of
trying to pass this clumsy monster off as a representation
of a crocodile—one of the most
familiar of objects.</p>

<p>Especially in view of the methods of construction
involved—a point on which no man is better
qualified than Petrie to pronounce an opinion—Budge
seems to have done nothing to invalidate
the Babylonian suggestion, which, for the rest,
takes its place very naturally, as we shall see, in
the explanation of the extraordinary wealth of
furniture found in the tomb of one of the least
famous Pharaohs of the XVIIIth Dynasty. The
couches seem, to an unprejudiced mind, just such
work as would be produced by a clever workman
working on motives which were quite foreign to
his usual practice, and therefore producing
results which, while they have a distinct
resemblance to the types which he was imitating,
yet show these as seen and interpreted by an
outsider, and not by one to whom they were parts
of his normal training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>Of the statues found in the tomb, two, the
life-sized ones of bituminised wood adorned with
gold, were fine specimens of the normal type
of tomb portrait; the third, the so-called
“Mannikin,” was of a different class. It was
only a half-length, and lacked the arms; but in
other respects it was a careful and artistic piece
of work and obviously a faithfully studied
portrait. The idea that its imperfect condition
is due to the fact that it was a sort of glorified
tailor’s dummy, on which the royal robes were
fitted before being worn by the Pharaoh, may
probably be dismissed without ceremony. It
is not obvious why, in a period when court dress
was of the most elaborate type, with long robes
of fine linen falling to the feet, and wide sleeves
coming almost to the elbow, the mannikin should
have neither legs nor arms, which one would
have judged essential for the purpose of trying
the fall of the robe. Another view was that it
was a portrait, not of Tutankhamen, but of his
wife, Ankh. s. en. Amen. There can be no doubt
about the quality of the portrait, though to talk
of “the strange pensive smile playing about the
lips, recalling the baffling smile of Da Vinci’s
Mona Lisa,” is to invite comparisons which are
scarcely fair to the older work of art; but it
certainly is not the portrait of a woman. It may
be a head-portrait of the type not uncommon in
Old Kingdom tombs; or it may be part of the
foundation of a copper statue, like that of Pepy
of the Old Kingdom, though in that case it is
difficult to see why it should have been so
carefully coloured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

<p>In the meantime it is impossible to say much
about the treasures of the sarcophagus-chamber
and its annexe. Scarcely more than a glimpse
has been vouchsafed of these, no more than
enough to whet curiosity and expectation. But
there can be little doubt that the splendour of
the two inner chambers will be in accordance
with the preface to it which the outer chambers
have yielded. No one can doubt the magnificence
of the great canopy, which in itself would be a
treasure beyond price; and all observers are
at one as to the marvellous beauty of the shrine
with the four goddesses. The motive of its
decoration is, of course, one perfectly familiar
in Egyptian art, and is found in all ages. The
beautiful pink granite sarcophagus of Tutankhamen’s
successor and enemy Horemheb, for
instance, has as part of its adornment another
version of the same idea of the protecting goddess.
But the detail of the Canopic Shrine, if it prove
to be such, appears to be of a quality and inspiration
rare even in the finest Egyptian work. For
the rest, we can only wait and hope.</p>

</figure>

<p>A good deal has been said about the need of
recasting our ideas of Egyptian history in the
light of the new information which has been
gained from the tomb of Tutankhamen, and some
writers have hinted that our whole conception
of the close of the XVIIIth Dynasty is wrong,
and must be recast to square with the new facts.
We are asked to discard the idea of an Egypt
beginning to decline from the lofty position which
she had held under Thothmes III and Amenhotep
III, and to substitute for this the picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
of an Egypt waking with renewed strength from
the uneasy religious dreams of the reign of
Akhenaten, and asserting once more, and with
greater vigour than ever, her dominion in the
realms of both politics and art.</p>

<p>All this is merely a vain imagination. Historically,
no new facts have emerged from the
tomb of Tutankhamen. It is scarcely true to
say, with Budge, that “we know no more now
about the reign of this king than we did before
Lord Carnarvon made his phenomenal discovery.”
That would only be the case on the narrow
reading of the meaning of history which would
confine it to the mere recording of dates, conquests,
and legislation. The art of any period
constitutes no small part of its history, and
for the history of far-past times it is one of
our most valuable sources of information; and
we may surely look for a large extension of our
knowledge of the art of ancient Egypt in the
reign of Tutankhamen from the treasures of his
tomb.</p>

<p>But so far as concerns the facts of what the
king, and Egypt under his leadership, accomplished
in the matter of raising again the declining
prestige and power of the Empire, we know no
more than we did before the tomb was opened;
nor is it likely that when the work is completed
we shall have gained much more information, if
any, on this point. For the likelihood is that if
there are any papyri beneath the great golden
canopy, they will be of a purely religious type,
versions of one or other of the different forms of
spiritual guide-book which the devout Egyptian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
carried with him on his long journey through the
dark Underworld.</p>

<p>The artistic value of the find is another matter.
There can be no question but that this splendid
collection of the finest work of the craftsmen of
the XVIIIth Dynasty, by far the greatest assemblage
of such work known to exist, will prove of
the utmost importance in shaping and correcting
our ideas of Egyptian art at one of the most
interesting points of its long development.
Never before has such a mass of material of the
highest class been available for study. Yet even
here it would be rash to assume that the result
will be any considerable modification of our
views as to the period of culmination of the art
of the New Empire. At the most, and assuming
that all the art of the tomb is strictly of the time
of the king with whose burial it is associated, and
that its quality is all of the supreme standard
which has been attributed to it, the net result
would be the shifting of the apex of the curve
a matter of thirty or thirty-five years, a small
thing when we are dealing with an art whose
history is written in millenniums. But it seems
likely that even this is more than we need
necessarily assume.</p>

<p>There is always the possibility that in the
tomb of Tutankhamen we are dealing, not only
with the splendours of one king, but perhaps
also with many of the heirlooms of the royal
house to which he belonged, in which case we
should be faced with specimens of the art, not
of one period of a few years’ duration, but with
those of perhaps a whole century, perhaps of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
longer period still. The work of sifting out the
various sources and periods of the materials
found in the tomb will prove a most fascinating,
if also a most difficult, task; when it is accomplished—the
work of years—we may be in a
position to speak more definitely about the change
or the confirmation which the tomb of Tutankhamen
has brought to our previous theories of
the growth and decline of Egyptian art; meanwhile
we must wait, with the assurance that even
in the extremest case, the discovery can scarcely
commit us to anything revolutionary of our
previous conceptions.</p>

<p>The mention of the possibility of some of the
articles found in the tomb being family heirlooms
of the XVIIIth Dynasty brings up the last
question with which it is necessary to deal in
this short survey. How does it come about that
a Pharaoh of no great standing in the long line
of Egyptian monarchs—a mere stopgap king,
a pigmy between giants—was buried with surroundings
whose splendour exceeds anything
known in all the story of royal magnificence?
The discoveries of Tutankhamen’s wonderful
funerary equipment make us wonder what we
may have lost in the fact that his is the only royal
tomb which has been found practically unrifled.
Had we found, for instance, the tomb of a really
great Pharaoh, such as Amenhotep III, as intact
as that of his descendant, we should have been in
a better position to form a judgment on the
matter; but that unfortunately has been denied
us. One suggestion may be made, with the
proviso that it is no more than a suggestion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
which may be confirmed or disproved by subsequent
investigation. It has already been suggested
that some of the most curious, if not the
most beautiful, of the finds are relics, not of the
time of Tutankhamen, but of Amenhotep III,
dating therefore from forty years before the time
when they were stored away in the Valley of
the Kings; and it has also been suggested that
another very interesting article, the footstool
with figures of Asiatic captives inlaid upon it,
dates from an even earlier period, that of
Amenhotep II, and is therefore a century older
than the time to which the burial belongs.</p>

<p>Tutankhamen, we know, was the last king of
the direct line of the XVIIIth Dynasty. His
widow, Ankh. s. en. Amen, was left in a most
insecure position from which she made, as we
know, a desperate and unavailing effort to
extricate herself. May it not be that, with the
consciousness that all the glories of her house
were in danger of passing to mere usurpers of
undistinguished origin, such as the obscure
priest Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamen, or the
commonplace soldier Horemheb, who drove Ay
from the throne, she secured at least some of the
most treasured heirlooms of the royal house
from desecration by hiding them in the tomb of
her dead husband?</p>

<p>It is, of course, only an idea, which must stand
or fall by the results of future study; but it
seems, at least in the meantime, to offer a reasonable
explanation of a point on which no other
explanation is for the present forthcoming.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Practically</span> the whole of our knowledge
of the conditions under which life
was lived in Egypt, of the organisation
of society, of the arts and crafts by which the
needs and tastes of the people were met, is due to
the results of excavation during the last century.
We owe, of course, a great deal to the statements
of Herodotus and Diodorus as to the conditions
which they found existing in their time; but
the great source of information must always be
the mass of first-hand material which has
been gathered, mainly from the tombs with their
wealth of funerary furnishings, by the work of
the excavator. Therefore it would seem that
the fitting conclusion to our brief survey of the
various aspects of excavation should be a sketch
of the life of ancient Egypt, with the arts and
crafts which ministered to its necessities and its
luxuries. Such a sketch must, of course, be of
the slightest and least elaborated type, for the
amount of material is so enormous that only the
most salient points can be touched; but it may
still be true so far as it goes, and may perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
serve as an outline within which further details
may be inserted by the student of ancient
Egyptian life.</p>

<p>First of all, we may take the framework of
society. Through the whole of Egyptian history
the outline of this is very much the same, though
there are many variations in the relative
importance of the various parts. The head of
the state is always the Pharaoh, placed on a level
immensely above even the most powerful of his
subjects, but, as we shall see, by no means an
irresponsible tyrant, but rather a limited monarch,
governing in accordance with strictly defined
customs.</p>

<p>Beneath him are the great nobles and the
great official class—two sections of society which
were not in ancient Egypt, as in so many other
ancient realms, virtually different names for the
same thing.</p>

<p>Then came the priestly class, at all times one
of the most important in the land, and tending
at certain periods, with the weakening of the royal
power, to overshadow all the other interests.</p>

<p>It appears that there was a definitely military
class, with definite lands assigned to it for its
support, though in the earlier days of the kingdom
the wars were not the business of a separate class
of professional soldiers, but were carried on by
a general levy of the people. The other great
land-holding class of the nation was that of the
husbandmen, who apparently were much of
our own old yeoman type, holding their land by
the payment of taxes.</p>

<p>Behind these classes, which, so to speak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
formed the backbone of the nation, came the
shepherds, hunters, artificers, traders, and workers
at other subsidiary occupations. These held no
land, and their occupations appear to have been
mainly hereditary, no artisan being allowed to
pass from one trade to another, or to have his
children reckoned in any other class than his own.
The various trades must have been organised
more or less after the plan of the mediæval trade-guilds,
though in the case of Egypt the organisation
was apparently a national, and not a local
affair. Beneath the tradesmen came the slave
class, whose number varied pretty much according
to the wars on which the nation was engaged,
and their fruitfulness, or the opposite, in yielding
captives.</p>

<p>Slave labour was never a prominent feature
of Egyptian life, and Petrie estimates the slave
population of the land at its maximum at no
more than a quarter of a million out of a possible
population of twelve millions.</p>

<p>To the imagination of most folk probably
the mention of “Pharaoh, King of Egypt,”
suggests a typical Oriental tyrant, responsible
to nothing but his own passions, and governing
according to the whim of the moment. Such a
picture may have been true of an Assyrian or
Babylonian king, like Ashurbanipal or Nebuchadnezzar,
and perhaps the frequency of assassination
in the records of the Assyrian kings hints that it
was; but it certainly was not true of ancient
Egypt. Pharaoh’s own grandiose inscriptions,
and the fiction which regarded him as a god
incarnate, may suggest unbridled power; but as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
a matter of fact, Pharaoh was anything but the
rampant and romantic despot whom we imagine
distributing life and death at his own capricious
will, but rather a somewhat humdrum constitutional
monarch, whose every action was regulated
for him centuries before he was born, by an
unchanging custom, and who could no more
step beyond the limits which immemorial laws
had assigned to him than he could jump out of
his skin, or off his own shadow.</p>

<p>The thing which amazed the Greeks, with
their experience of irresponsible tyrants, was the
fact that so great a king as Pharaoh was not the
master, but the servant of the laws. “He could
not do any public business, condemn or punish
any man to gratify his own humour or revenge,
or for any other unjust cause; but was bound
to do according as the laws had ordered in every
particular case.... The kings, therefore, carrying
this even hand towards all their subjects,
were more beloved by them than by their own
kindred.”</p>

<p>Petrie has suggested that it is this limitation
of the power of the Pharaoh which is accountable
for the unusual stability of the Egyptian throne.
“The absence of republican interludes, so
frequent in other parts of the Mediterranean, was
apparently due to the monarchy being strictly
limited by law. However bad an Egyptian might
be personally, he could not earn the hatred of his
subjects like the irresponsible Greek tyrants or
Roman emperors.”</p>

<p>Indeed Pharaoh according to fact is a very
different figure from Pharaoh according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
imagination. We must try to substitute for the
gorgeous tiger of our fancies the figure, gorgeous
enough indeed, so far as concerns his apparel,
of a laborious servant of the State whose life,
instead of being spent in wild orgies of licence
and wild explosions of ferocity, was mainly
occupied, from the time when he rose in the
morning to the time when he crawled to bed at
night, in a manner quite familiar to royalty in
our own country, in signing dull reports, and
reading dull dispatches, presiding over long and
wearisome temple services, and travelling about
the country to see that everything was working
smoothly.</p>

<p>The new picture is by no means so picturesque
as the old one; but it is the real Pharaoh, and
no doubt it was for the good, both of his subjects
and himself, that “Pharaoh had to act every hour
according to fixed routine, without room for
the licence of a Dionysius or a Caligula.” The
brilliant tiger looks romantic in a story, but when
his despotism becomes unbearable it has generally
to be tempered by assassination, as with Sargon,
Sennacherib, and many another; but as a matter
of fact the Egyptian Pharaoh generally managed
to die quietly in his own bed when his time
came.</p>

<p>Not that he had not his own power, and his
own initiative. His headship of the State involved
headship of the army in war, and this was no
polite fiction, where Pharaoh reaped the glory
while his soldiers had the danger. Seqenen-Ra’s
mummy, with its ghastly wounds on head
and face, tells us how real was the duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
of Egyptian royalty in the day of battle.
Thothmes III led the van of his army through
the defile of Aaruna, when his chosen captains
shirked the task, and though we need not believe
all that Ramses II tells us about his share in the
battle of Kadesh, there is no doubt that he fought
hand to hand with the Hittites in the forefront
of the battle, and at least proved himself a good
trooper, whatever may be thought of his generalship.
Much power also lay in his hands in
respect of the selection and advancement of
able men from the lower to the higher ranks
of the public service, and of rewarding their
work with grants of land, of initiating the great
public works which were often of such untold
benefit to the land, and of conducting the
Foreign-Office business of the country, and the
negotiation of treaties. In short, Pharaoh had
no lack of work to do, and was probably like his
modern successors in Kingship, one of the
hardest-worked men in the land; but from
start to finish, the Egyptian monarchy was a
limited one.</p>

<p>Two instances of the limitation of the royal
power, and its strict subjection to law, may be
given. When Queen Amtes was tried, in the
reign of Pepy I of the VIth Dynasty, for some
unspecified offence, the trial was conducted
without even the presence of the king. “His
Majesty,” says Una in his famous inscription,
“caused me to enter in order to hear the case
alone. No chief judge and vizier at all, no prince
at all was there, but only I alone, because I was
excellent, because I was pleasant to the heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
of His Majesty.” Again, in the time of King
Ramses III of the XXth Dynasty, there was a
great palace conspiracy arising out of an intrigue
in the harem to dethrone Ramses, and put the
son of one of the harem ladies on the throne.
In most other Oriental palaces the discovery of
such a thing would have been the signal for a
general massacre. Instead of executing summary
justice, Ramses appointed a commission,
giving them these remarkable instructions:
“What the people have spoken, I do not know.
Hasten to investigate it. You will go and
question them, and those who must die, you will
cause to die by their own hand, without my
knowing anything of it. You will also cause the
punishment awarded to the others to be carried
out without my knowing anything of it.”</p>

<p>Pharaoh may not always have been a model
of propriety or of rectitude; but he was far
too strictly hedged about by precedent to allow
of the brutal tyranny and licence which have so
often marked other Eastern monarchies, and,
besides, one fails to see how, with his time so
completely filled as we know it to have been,
with all sorts of necessary routine, he can have
had much opportunity for mischief, even if he
had the desire.</p>

<p>The king’s chief functionary and right-hand
man was the Vizier, who must have been just
about as hard-worked a man as his master. The
inscription in the tomb of Rekhmara, who was
vizier under Thothmes III, enumerates thirty
separate functions which had to be discharged
by the fortunate holder of this great office. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
vizier is Grand Steward of all Egypt, and all the
activities of the State are under his control.
He has general oversight of the treasury, and the
chief treasurer reports to him; he is chief justice,
or head of the judiciary; he is chief of police,
both for the residence-city and the kingdom;
he is minister of war, both for army and navy;
he is secretary of the interior and of agriculture,
while all general executive functions of State,
with many that may not be classified, are
incumbent upon him. There is indeed no
prime function of the State which does not
operate through his office. He is a veritable
Joseph, and it must be this office which the
Hebrew writer has in mind in the story of
Joseph.” Altogether we may conclude that,
whatever the salary of the vizier may have been,
he probably earned it.</p>

<p>A quaint picture of the way in which a high
Egyptian official was hedged about with routine
is given by Rekhmara in his description of the
procedure of the court of justice. “As for every
act of this official, the vizier while hearing in
the hall of the vizier, he shall sit upon a chair,
with a rug upon the floor, and a dais upon it, a
cushion under his back, a cushion under his feet,
and a baton at his hand; the forty skins [parchments
of the codified law] shall be open before
him. Then the magnates of the South shall
stand in the two aisles before him, while the
master of the privy chamber is on his right,
the receiver of income on his left, the scribes of
the vizier at his either hand; one corresponding
to another, with each man at his proper place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
One shall be heard after another, without
allowing one who is behind to be heard before
one who is in front.”</p>

<p>The great offices of State, of course, often fell
to men of high rank, and of hereditary influence.
Rekhmara himself came of noble family, and
succeeded his uncle in the vizierate. But this
was by no means necessarily the case. Egypt
always presented the career open to talent which
Napoleon desired. “All through the history
there was a free rising of ability from the lower
levels, as we see in England—Wolsey, the
butcher’s son, and many others.... This was
a chief cause of the durability of Egyptian society;
great as the differences were, there was a gradation
interlocking all through, as in England.”</p>

<p>A notable instance of the rise of a talented man
is given by the tomb-inscription of that same
Una whom we have already seen presiding over
the trial of Queen Amtes. Beginning his official
career as an “inferior custodian of the domain of
Pharaoh,” Una during three reigns steadily
climbed up the official ladder, until at last he
became governor of the South under Merenra,
and was the favoured official chosen to fetch
the granite for the royal sarcophagus and pyramid
from the quarries at Aswan. Senmut again, the
famous architect and minister of Queen
Hatshepsut, tells us in the inscription on his
statue at Karnak that he was “the greatest
of the great in the whole land,” and seems to have
held power not inferior to that of the vizier,
though there is no evidence that he held that
office; yet he tells us in his Berlin inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
that “his ancestors were not found in writing,”
or in other words, that he was a self-made man.</p>

<p>The elaborately organised court held many
offices both ornamental and useful, which gave
openings for talent or ambition. Perhaps one
of the most influential positions was one which
involved no very important duties, but brought
the holder of it into close and constant touch
with Pharaoh. This was the position of the
“fan-bearer at the king’s right hand.” His
function was purely ornamental, and he can be
seen in paintings and reliefs carrying a tiny fan
beside the king’s litter as the symbol of his office,
while the real work of fanning is done by the
ordinary fan-bearers with their big business-like
fans; but he was the highest court-official, a
sort of Lord Chamberlain, with powers of giving
or denying entry to the presence, and no doubt
his favour was all-important to a petitioner, as that
of one who had the ear of Pharaoh. As to the
rest of the court, there was a multitude of officials
quite comparable to the tail of useless boot-lickers
who adorned the court of Louis XIV;
but one imagines that, in earlier days at least,
the courtier of Pharaoh had to do more for his
position than the hanger-on of the Grand
Monarque.</p>

<p>The priesthood formed a very large and very
influential class. In theory, the King was always
the Supreme Priest, the Pontifex Maximus of
the kingdom, and very often several of the high-priesthoods
of the different gods were held by
members of the royal family, thus securing that
the Pharaoh should be represented in the priestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
councils whose loyalty or disloyalty might mean
so much to the stability of his throne. Thus in
the reign of Ramses II, his favourite son
Khaemuast, the Wizard-Prince of the Setna
papyrus, was high-priest of Ptah at Memphis.
No doubt the fact that there was such a multitude
of gods, whose priesthoods were all jealous of
one another, was some security against the
overwhelming influence of the priestly caste,
especially in the earlier days; but the fate of
Akhenaten’s movement showed that in spite of
local jealousies the priestly caste was really one
in face of any attempt to diminish its power and
privileges; and in the end the unquestioned
supremacy of Amen led to the Amen priesthood
gaining a position and influence which was
superior to that of the weak Ramesside Pharaohs,
and which resulted in the supersession of the
true royal line, and the substitution for it of the
XXIst Dynasty of priest-kings. Even before
things had reached such a pitch, the immense
wealth which the piety of successive kings had
accumulated in the coffers of the priesthoods,
and especially of that of Amen, must have
constituted a real danger to the state, while the
amount of land held by the priests, and so
exempt from taxation, went with the other
accumulation to constitute a steady drain on the
national resources which in the end they were not
able to bear.</p>

<p>The class of the great nobles was held in
strict subordination to the royal power in the
days of the strong early monarchs of the Old
Kingdom; but, with the weakening of the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
authority which followed the Vth Dynasty, the
honours and powers which Pharaoh had heaped
on his faithful courtiers, and which had been a
convenient relief to the central authority as
shifting part of the burden of local administration
to the shoulders of the local great men, proved
a danger to the State. A kind of feudal system
grew up in which the local chieftains assumed the
powers and as much as they could afford of the
splendours of Pharaoh himself, claiming to hold
their offices by hereditary right, maintaining
their own armies, holding their own courts of
justice, and even daring to place after their own
names in their proclamations the formula,
“Living for ever and ever,” which had hitherto
been the sacred attribute of the crown alone.</p>

<p>The revival of the monarchy, first under the
Antefs and Mentuhoteps of the XIth Dynasty,
and then under the Senuserts and Amenemhats
of the XIIth Dynasty, however, soon curbed
the pretensions of these petty princelets, and the
changes of the Hyksos invasion and the War of
Independence wiped out the last relics of the
Egyptian feudal system, which never revived
under the New Empire. Even under strong
kings like the Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom,
the courts of the local nomarchs were no small
things, as they might employ anything from
fifty to a hundred officials, from the steward down
to the “mat-spreader.”</p>

<figure id="il_28" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 43em;">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tomb-inscriptions are not perhaps the most
trustworthy sources as to the personal character
of a class of men, nor are we to expect that Ameny
or Khnemhotep will tell us anything of the shady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
side of their administration. Yet it must be
confessed that Ameny’s story of his administration
of the Oryx Nome gives a pleasant picture of the
relations of a great local noble and official to the
people of his province; and we may say that
if Egypt in the time of the Middle Kingdom had
many nomarchs of his stamp, she was a fortunate
land.</p>

<p>“There was no citizen’s daughter whom I
misused,” says the great man, “there was no
widow whom I oppressed, there was no peasant
whom I repulsed, there was no shepherd whom I
repelled, there was not a foreman of five from
whom I took his men for forced work. There
was not a pauper around me; there was not a
hungry man of my time. When there came years
of famine, I arose, I ploughed all the fields of
the Oryx Nome to its southern and its northern
boundary, I kept its inhabitants alive, making
provision so that there was not a hungry man
in it. I gave to the widow as to her that possessed
a husband; nor did I exalt the great above the
small in all that I gave. Thereafter great rises
of the Nile took place, producing wheat and
barley and all things; but I did not exact the
arrears of the farm.” “I gave bread to the
hungry,” says another noble, “and clothes to
the naked, and gave a passage in my own boat
to those who could not cross. I was a father to
the orphan, a husband to the widow, a protection
from the wind to the shivering; I am one who
spake what was good, and related what was good.
I acquired my possessions in a just manner.”</p>

<p>All this may savour a little of Pharisaic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
self-righteousness to us; but at least it shows
that there was a recognised idea, among the
governing class, of the duties which a great man
owed to those under him, and the possession of
such an ideal must have made bad government
more difficult.</p>

<p>The same praise can scarcely be given to the
ideals of the other important, though minor,
official class, the scribes. The Egyptian scribe
belonged to a type with which we are perfectly
familiar still, the type of the petty official who
thinks that there is nothing in all the world so
fine as petty officialdom, unless it be superior
officialdom, and who looks down on all other
professions with a scorn which is only equalled
by his ignorance. In a land where writing was
so complicated a matter, and where it so early
assumed supreme importance, where also the
annual inundation with its obliterating of landmarks
made the possession of written records a
matter of great importance, the scribe obviously
had a splendid field for his work, and for the
development of all his peculiar vices. It was
possible for a careful scribe to climb from the
humblest position to one of great dignity and
power, and the Egyptian scribe never forgot that
every scribe carried in his writing-case the wand
of office of a potential vizier.</p>

<p>The scribes have left us many examples of
what they thought of themselves and of all other
people and professions, and it may be safely
said that of no other class of Egyptian do we
carry away so unpleasant an impression as of
that one which no doubt imagined that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
impressing its own immense superiority on the
minds of all posterity. The Egyptian cherished
a profound admiration for learning; but his
devotion to letters was not because of the beauty
of learning in itself, but simply because it was
the avenue to preferment and the way of escape
from the miseries of toil or the dangers of war.
Both the admiration and the mercenary reason
for it are expressed in the words of an ancient
sage recorded for us in the Sallier Papyrus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Give thy heart to learning and love her like a mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For there is nothing that is so precious as learning ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold there is no profession which is not governed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is only the learned man who rules himself.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The scribe saw himself, because of his
possession of letters, immeasurably above all the
poor creatures who had to earn their bread by
the sweat of their brow. He was exempt from
all the pains and anxieties of the workman, and
loved maliciously to contemplate them while
he issued the orders which imposed further
burdens on backs already heavily burdened.
“The poor ignorant man, ‘whose name is
unknown, is like a heavily-laden donkey, he is
driven by the scribe,’ while the fortunate man
‘who has set his heart upon learning’ is above
work, and becomes a wise prince.” “The
learned man has enough to eat because of his
learning.” Therefore, “set to work and become
a scribe, for then thou shalt become a leader of
men.”</p>

<p>No matter what the trade was, or how
wonderful its results, it seemed to the smug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
scribe a contemptible thing in comparison with
his own precious profession of letters. Here
is his opinion of the craftsmen who created the
miracles of metal- and wood-work of the Middle
Kingdom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I have never seen the smith as an ambassador,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the goldsmith carry tidings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I have seen the smith at his work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the mouth of his furnace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His fingers were like crocodile skin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He stank more than the roe of fish ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each artist who works with the chisel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tires himself more than he who hoes a field.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wood is his field, of metal are his tools.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the night—is he free?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He works more than his arms are able,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the night—he lights a light.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No doubt this seemed very fine and humorous
to our scribe; but we who have the chance of
comparing his literary achievement with the
works of the craftsmen whom he satirised may
be pardoned for preferring the diadems of
Khnumit and Sat-Hathor, or the statues of
Senusert and Amenemhat to all the paltry drivel
he ever wrote.</p>

</figure>

<p>Nor was his opinion of the soldier’s calling
any higher. Indeed the ancient Egyptian was
no more of a warlike person than his successor
the modern fellah, who makes a good enough
soldier under British officers, but is about the
most unmilitary person on earth when left to
the freedom of his own will. There is no more
curious inversion of fact than the common idea
which pictures the Egyptian as one of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
warrior races of the world, and classes him along
with that bloodthirsty tiger the Assyrian. Only at
one period of his history did the Egyptian ever
show the least sign of developing a craving for
world-dominion and the warfare which goes
along with it; and when the brief imperial fever
of his early XVIIIth Dynasty had wrought itself
out, he reverted for the rest of his history to his
natural rôle of the finest craftsman on earth,
only bestirring himself when there was need
to defend his frontiers, a business which he did
fairly, but only fairly, well. On the whole, he
would have thoroughly agreed with Alan Breck
Stewart that war “is generally rather a bauchle
of a business.”</p>

<p>But it was reserved for the smug and flabby
scribe—you can see him still in the Louvre with
his cunning eyes and his rolls of unhealthy
flesh—to make a mock of the calling which won
for Egypt all the empire she ever possessed, and
which was that of her greatest Pharaohs.</p>

<p>“Oh, what does it mean,” says this early
pacifist, “Oh, what does it mean that thou
sayest: ‘The officer has a better lot than the
scribe’? Come, let me relate to thee the fate of
the officer, so full of trouble.” Then he goes
on to relate in a fashion which he no doubt
thinks humorous, the life of an officer on active
duty in Syria:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Come, let me relate to thee how he travels to Syria,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How he marches in the upland country.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His food and his water he has to carry on his arm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laden like a donkey;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This makes his neck stiff like that of a donkey,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the bones of his back break ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he arrives in face of the enemy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He is like a bird in a snare ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he arrives at his home in Egypt ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He is ill, and must lie down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They have to bring him home on the donkey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whilst his clothes are stolen, and his servants run away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore, O scribe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reverse thine opinion about the happiness of the scribe and of the officer.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As literature this precious effusion is merely
contemptible; but it is very illuminating as to
the character of the class which was responsible
for the production of it. Generally speaking, the
Egyptian leaves you with the pleasant impression
that he is a decent kindly fellow, with a cheery
outlook on life, and a love of pretty things and
laughter; but the scribe is an undoubted fly
in the ointment. He thought himself its finest
perfume; but that is just precisely what makes
him so unquestionably the fly.</p>

<p>We need not imagine that the condition either
of the soldier or of the artisan was quite so miserable
as the scribe would have us believe. The
misfortune is that it was only the scribe who
was vocal. If the soldier or the craftsman had
been able to leave behind him his opinion of
the scribe, it would probably have been quite
as unflattering, and perhaps more pungently
expressed. It would not have required great
genius to make fun of a profession which lived
by the favour of the great man, and whose typical
figure is the kneeling scribe of the Cairo Museum,
with his twisted deprecating smile, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
submissively crossed hands, waiting, like a dog,
uncertain whether his master will kick him or
fling him a bone.</p>

<p>Behind all the glitter of the court and official
circle, with its innumerable hangers-on, there
comes the great mass of the people, the farmers,
the skilled workmen, the shepherds, fishers,
toilers of all sorts. Of no race in the world can
it be said that the conditions of its workers have
been so fully depicted as of the Egyptians. On
the sculptured and painted tomb-reliefs we see
the workmen of almost every trade under heaven
busily engaged in the prosecution of their calling.
Whatever the scribe might think of the indignity
of being a smith or a carpenter, his impression
was confined to himself, and the great man had
not the least objection to see these and a score of
other common occupations pictured on the walls
of his “eternal habitation.” But while the outward
aspect of these callings is thus fully represented,
so that it might be possible to produce
a handbook of the Egyptian crafts, we are not so
well informed as to the environment in which
these wonderfully skilled workmen spent their
lives, what were the conditions of their service,
the manner of their housing, and the question of
whether their lot was a happy one or not.
Petrie’s excavations at Kahun have given us the
almost complete plan of an Old Kingdom
workmen’s town, where the skilled masons who
were building the pyramid of Senusert II were
housed. Though this is only a temporary town,
we may probably take its conditions as more or
less typical of those which prevailed for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
artisan class in the Old Kingdom. The houses
are of all sizes, ranging from four rooms to sixty,
the larger houses being, no doubt, those of the
overseers and clerks of works. The streets are
narrow, varying from 11 feet to 15 feet wide,
and having a drain down the middle of each.
The simplest type of small house has an open
court opposite the entrance, a common room
on one side, and two storerooms on the other,
with a stair leading up to the roof. The larger
class of artisan’s house has a court, four rooms
opening off it, and five other rooms dependent
on the main rooms. On the whole, one would
imagine that the housing conditions were not so
very bad; though certainly the houses were too
crowded together. The average artisan’s house
of the present day has not the number of rooms
which were possessed by the pyramid mason of
four thousand years ago, though his advantages
in other respects are considerable.</p>

<p>The workman’s wages were at all events
partly paid in kind. Herodotus tells us of the
amount expended in provision for the workmen
who built the Great Pyramid: “On the pyramid
is shown an inscription, in Egyptian characters,
how much was expended in radishes, onions, and
garlic, for the workmen; which the interpreter,
as I well remember, reading the inscription,
told me amounted to one thousand six hundred
talents of silver.” Payment was still in kind
in the time of the New Empire. One of the
foremen of the craftsmen of the Theban
necropolis in the time of Ramses IX (1142–1123
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), fortunately kept with great care a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
record of all that happened to his gang, noting
whether the men were on full work or were
“idle.” Festival days broke in considerably on
their working time, as we hear of two full months’
holiday, and again of another month, in the same
year; but the workmen’s rations ran on all the
same whether they were working or not. The
worry was that the rations were often behind
time, and when that happened there was trouble.
One month the rations were only one day late,
but another they did not come at all, and then the
workmen went on strike. This produced the
supplies; but ere long the same thing happened
again, and this time the gang went in a body to
Thebes, and complained to the “great princes,”
and the “chief prophets of Amen.” Again the
result was good, and the journal of the careful
foreman gives us a quaint hint of how it had been
necessary to use a little palm-oil in the case of
the influential “fan-bearer” to secure the desired
end. “We received to-day our corn-rations;
we gave two boxes and a writing-tablet to the
fan-bearer.”</p>

<p>We cannot be sure whether the condition of
the necropolis workmen, who were mostly skilled
craftsmen, metal workers, carvers, painters, and
so forth, was worse than that of the workmen
in the city of the living; probably the conditions
in both cases were much the same. In any case,
it is the necropolis workmen who supply us with
our instances of insufficient or delayed payment,
and who give us the first historic examples of
strikes. In the twenty-ninth year of Ramses III
(1170 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) things were pretty bad in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
necropolis, and wages had not been paid for half
a year. After giving the officials nine days’ grace,
the workmen naturally went on strike in a body.</p>

<p>They left the necropolis, with their wives and
children, and though the two overseers tried to
entice them back to work “with great oaths,”
the workmen were not to be caught with chaff,
and stayed outside the necropolis walls. Finally
the affair assumed so threatening an aspect that
two chiefs of police and a number of priests
tried to make them return to duty; but in vain.
Their answer was, “We have been driven here
by hunger and thirst, we have no clothes, we have
no oil, we have no food. Write to our lord the
Pharaoh on the subject, and write to the governor
who is over us that they may give us something
for our sustenance.” This unheard-of request
had its effect—“on that day they received the
provision for the month Tybi.” In another
month, however, they were back again, as
supplies had failed once more. This time the
governor of the town met them, and though he
asked them how he was to pay their wages when
the storehouses were empty, he at least ordered
that they should receive half of the overdue
rations.</p>

<p>Altogether the evidence goes to show that
life was not all pleasure in ancient Egypt, any
more than in other lands; but it is only fair to
say that the other side of the matter has been
grossly exaggerated, and that life in the Land of
the Pharaohs was not the gloomy, morbid,
perpetually death-contemplating thing which it
has been represented as being. This idea, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
course, we owe, partly to the amiable Herodotus
and his picture of the model coffin and mummy
being carried round at all their banquets, with the
words, “Look on this, then drink and enjoy
yourself; for when dead you will be like this,”
and partly to the fact that practically all the
knowledge we have of the Egyptians comes from
their tombs.</p>

<p>The necessary corrective to this one-sided
view of a great nation is given by their books, and
particularly by the romantic fiction which they
were the first nation to cultivate. Erman has
said that “the romances are not to be relied
upon; the country which they describe is not
Egypt but fairyland.” This may be so as regards
scenery and detail; but the writer of the Tale
of the Doomed Prince, or of Setna and the Magic
Roll, whether he may cast the scene of his story
in Naharina or in Egypt, cannot help revealing
in his tale the habitual outlook on life of the
Egypt of his time; and in this respect the
romances are far more to be relied upon than
either the vainglorious vauntings of a royal
inscription or the carefully dressed-up moralisings
of a scribe. The picture which they give
of the Egyptian nature is that of a simple, kindly
race, singularly free from the savage cruelty which
disgraced their great rivals the Assyrians, loving
pleasure, and all the brightness and beauty of
life, with a straightforward and childlike affection,
not greedy of power, but ready to live and let
live, singularly advanced in their conception of
family life, and especially worthy of our admiration
in the respect which they paid to women, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
the position accorded to woman from the very
earliest times.</p>

<p>It is time to rid our minds of that sinister
conception of the Egyptian as a dark, uncanny,
supernaturally wise and diabolically malignant
being, which is still to be found in second-rate
fiction, and in the vain imaginings of gropers in
the occult and the miraculous, and to see this
great race as it really was—a race of true children
of the Sun, leading in the dawn of the world’s
story a clean, healthy, open-air life, with its
own imperfections and weaknesses, but with its
plain virtues as well, and with a moral standard
not unworthy of comparison with that of any
race in the world. What they have accomplished
is plain for all the world to see; surely it is
common sense to see also that such things were
not the work of gloomy fanatics or of drivelling
dabblers in the black arts, but of men.</p>

<p>We turn now to consider the art of ancient
Egypt as it has now come to be known by the
accumulation of specimens of it during the last
century. Egyptian art has been somewhat slow
in coming to its own in the judgment of the world,
and that for two reasons. First that opinion,
which had been accustomed to very different
things, had to be gradually trained to appreciate
the merit of work which differed from the
accepted canons in many respects, even in the
type of material which it used for its self-expression;
and next, that the Egyptian work by which
the national art was first introduced to the attention
of the modern world was mostly of a period
which we have now learned to know as decadent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
Denderah, Esneh, Edfu, Philæ, these were the
products of Egyptian art which first roused the
wonder of European visitors; and very naturally,
for these great shrines are not only wonderful in
themselves, but are also in a state of preservation
which renders them intelligible and attractive to
everyone who sees them. But all the same they
are very unworthy to be taken as examples of
what Egyptian art could do at its best, and so we
need not wonder that, when the first impulse of
surprise had passed away, the voice of criticism
was heard, pointing out the conspicuous faults
in this claimant for recognition among the great
arts of the world, and refusing to allow the claim.
Similarly with the works of sculpture on which
another part of the Egyptian claim must be based,
in almost all cases the specimens of Egyptian
sculpture which were first brought under the
eyes of the judges were colossal fragments of a
style and a period which had their own merits,
but were far from being representative of the
actual work of the Egyptian sculptor at its best,
as we have now come to know it.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it is not to be wondered
at that Egyptian art has only found slow and
grudging recognition as one of the great arts of
the world. What is strange, however, is that
even to-day, when the periods of Egyptian
architecture are as clearly defined, perhaps more
clearly defined than the periods of Gothic, and
when Egyptian sculpture is represented all over
the world by either originals or reproductions
of its best work in all respects, the judgment which
was not unaccountable, or inapplicable in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
day of the beginnings of knowledge of things
Egyptian should still be repeated, and Egyptian
art be characterised as a thing, interesting indeed,
but essentially crude and barbaric, the product
of a race which has no claim to rank alongside
the other great artistic races of the world.</p>

<p>Thus we find so learned an art critic as Lord
Balcarres remarking (<cite>Donatello</cite>, p. 21), “The
massive and abiding art of Egypt ignored the
personality of its gods and Pharaohs, distinguishing
the various persons by dress, ornament,
and attribute.” For the gods, this may pass, but
when such a thing is said of the Pharaohs one
can only say that it is simply the opposite of the
truth. Is it possible that the author of such a
statement had never seen, before he made it,
such vivid impressions of personality as the great
diorite Khafra, with its splendid dignity, or, at
the opposite end of the scale, the Reisner
Menkaura, the very embodiment of a bourgeois
“Farmer George” royalty, doing his best to
look as dignified as becomes the wearer of the
double crown, and failing so absolutely? Here
are two successive occupants of the Egyptian
throne, whose personality, according to Lord
Balcarres, should be ignored in Egyptian art,
and yet the sharp discrimination of personality
is just the thing that immediately strikes everyone
who sees the two statues together.</p>

<p>Lord Balcarres, however, is not the only
sinner in this respect. “The emptiness of the
Sphinx’s face,” says Mr. March Phillipps in
his charming book, <cite>The Works of Man</cite>, “is a
prevailing trait in all Egyptian sculpture. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Egyptian faces stare before them with the same
blank regard which can be made to mean anything
precisely because it means nothing....
The truth is, Egyptian sculpture is a sculpture
barren of intellectual insight and intellectual
interest.”</p>

<p>Has the writer of this confident condemnation,
one wonders, ever seen the granite Senusert III,
either of the Cairo or of the British Museum,
with the strong harsh features which express, if
ever any work of the sculptor’s hands expressed,
both the pride and the bitter weariness of power,
or, to take a New Empire instance, the masterful
Thothmes III of the Cairo Museum, the face of
a daring soldier, if there ever was one, or the ugly
capable face of Prince Mentuemhat, also at
Cairo? Mentuemhat has no claims to personal
beauty, and, one imagines, no illusions on that
matter; but strong character has seldom been
more admirably expressed than in this specimen
of the art which, as we are told, is “barren of
intellectual insight and intellectual interest.”</p>

<p>The fact is, that both these criticisms, and
many others similar to them, rest upon a fundamental
misconception about Egyptian sculpture.
It is quite obvious that both Lord Balcarres and
Mr. March Phillipps, in making them, are
founding upon the colossal pieces of Egyptian
sculpture which are the prominent objects in the
galleries of our Museums, and taking them as
adequately representative of the art which they
are criticising; and to do this is hopelessly to
misconceive the actual position.</p>

<p>Egyptian sculpture in the round had two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
entirely different objects, which were reached by
different methods, and are seen in different
examples. The first was purely monumental
and decorative, and its purposes are served by the
production of the colossal statues, monuments
of royal pride and glory, and, not less, pieces
of decoration in a great architectural scheme.
These gigantic works are not to be viewed as
portraiture in the strict sense, and that the
Egyptians themselves did not so view them is
manifest from the fact that a reigning Pharaoh
seldom hesitated to appropriate to himself any
convenient statues of one of his predecessors by
the simple process of cutting his own cartouche
on the figure, and obliterating that of the original
owner.</p>

<p>The question of likeness or unlikeness was a
very small one; what was required was a figure
which should convey the impression of power and
dignity, linked with the name of a particular
Pharaoh. In this respect, and as elements of an
architectural whole, these statues unquestionably
served their purpose; more was never expected
of them, and to criticise them as lacking in
expression, and in individuality, is to do them an
injustice. They can only be judged as what
they were designed to be, not as something
radically different.</p>

<figure id="il_32" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="1920" height="1333" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">32. PTOLEMAIC RELIEF-WORK, KOM OMBOS.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The position is quite different with regard
to the other object of Egyptian sculpture, which
was definitely portraiture. Apart from his monumental
work, which in a limited sense may be
said to have ideal elements in it, the Egyptian
sculptor, unlike his successor, the Greek, produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
no ideal work. He was simply and solely, from
first to last, a portrait sculptor, and in this respect
he has seldom been excelled. The whole object
of his work was to produce a tomb-statue, which
should be the refuge of the <em>Ka</em> of the dead man
when his mummy had perished by lapse of time.
Therefore the one condition of his art was that
it should produce likenesses as absolute as the
power of man could compass. The result of
such an aim is manifest, both in the successes
and in the limitations of Egyptian sculpture. In
the one point to which he gave his whole strength,
the sculptor scored, not always, of course, but in
many instances, a most astonishing success. It
is impossible to imagine anything more lifelike
than the heads of some of the Old Kingdom
statues—the Ti or the Ranefer of the Cairo
Museum, or among royal statues, the Menkaura
with the figures of the Nomes, or in later times
the exquisite Berlin head of Queen Nefertiti,
the astonishing ebony head of a royal princess
of the same period, who may be Queen Tiy, or,
to come down to still later days, the other head
of Mentuemhat which Miss Benson and
Miss Gourlay unearthed from the temple of
Mut, or in the very latest days of Egyptian independence,
the head of an unknown man in green
schist which is now in the Berlin Museum.
Until the rise of Roman portrait-sculpture,
no ancient school of art presents anything to be
compared with the realism of the ancient Egyptian
sculptor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the completeness of his
art, the absolute dominance of the need for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
recognisable likeness in the head limited his
work in other respects. So long as the head was
a success, the rest of the body did not matter so
much; and consequently we have, even in such
fine examples as the Ti and the Ranefer, a noble
head joined to a body which is much less
thoroughly studied, while in examples of poorer
quality the contrast between the care with which
the head is worked out and the rude blocking
out of the torso and the extremities is almost
ludicrous. Still, Egyptian art, like all art, is
entitled to be judged by its best, and not, as has
so often been done, by its worst; and even when
we admit all its limitations the fact remains that
to charge it with incapacity to interpret individuality
is, to anyone who is familiar with its
best work, merely ridiculous.</p>

<p>The case is the same when we turn to the
criticisms which have been directed against the
other great branch of Egyptian sculpture—its
relief-work. The great reliefs of the temples,
with their battle pictures and scenes of offerings,
are what at once commands the attention and
invites the criticism. We are told, and very
justly so far, that “Kings, gods, prisoners, the
smiting champion, and the transfixed victim
are all equally expressionless. Clearly the idea
that art can be charged with, and visibly body
forth, the emotions and ideas of the human mind
was never grasped by Egyptian sculptors”;
but who in the world ever dreamed of taking
the vast advertisements of the glory and valour
of Pharaoh, for that is what the battle reliefs of
Karnak and Medinet Habu are—contract work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
at so much the square yard—as fair representatives
of the delicate and most decorative
work which has given us the tomb-reliefs of the
Old Kingdom?</p>

<p>In some respects Egyptian relief-work is
decidedly inferior to the remarkable animal
sculpture with which the Assyrian kings decorated
their palaces. The Egyptian sculptor rarely
attempts anything like the difficulty of the
problems of motion which the Assyrian tackled
with such dash and light-heartedness, and when
he does make the attempt his work is apt to seem
stiff beside that of his rival, whose hunting
scenes have rarely been equalled; but in his
portrayal of quiet scenes of home, field, and
farmyard the Egyptian comes to his own again,
and it is difficult to imagine anything more
effective as wall decoration than his quiet and
unstrained work, which, unlike that of the bitter
Assyrian, almost invariably leaves a pleasant
impression on the mind.</p>

<p>The comprehension and appreciation of
Egyptian architecture has been hindered by the
same fact which has delayed the appreciation of
the art of the Nile Valley—namely, that the
specimens of it which are to-day the most
complete, and which command for that reason
most attention, belong, not to the days when
Egypt was at the summit of her achievement in
all respects, but to periods when taste and artistic
feeling were decaying along with power. To
take, as is often done, such a temple as Medinet
Habu as fairly representative of Egyptian architecture,
is simply to make adequate appreciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
of what Egyptian architecture is a thing
impossible. The Egyptian builders had, no
doubt, great faults, which have already been
touched upon. They were often, indeed almost
always, strangely careless about the very factors
which should ensure the “eternal duration”
which they craved for the works of their hands;
they had, generally speaking, comparatively little
of that exquisite sense of proportion which makes
a fine Greek temple seem a thing inevitable,
though sometimes, as at Der el-Bahri, and the
little temple of Amenhotep III at Elephantine,
now, alas, destroyed, something of this was
revealed to them; they sometimes mistook mere
mass for greatness, and the multiplication of
forms for beauty, as in the Hypostyle Hall at
Karnak, where a magnificent opportunity was
lost because the architect did not know that too
much is too much. But with it all they have
left us a heritage of which it can safely be said
that few of the works of man can surpass it in
impressiveness. “It is a part of my intention,”
says Mr. Lethaby (<cite>Architecture</cite>, pp. 65, 66), “to
try to point out what contributions were made to
universal architecture by the several civilisations
as they arose and passed away, but to do so of
Egypt would be practically to rewrite what has
been said; to a large degree Architecture is an
Egyptian art.”</p>

<p>The nation of which such a statement can be
made needs no further witness as to its place
among the great master-building nations of the
world’s history.</p>

<p>Whatever hesitations and doubts there may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
be as to the right of the ancient Egyptian to rank
high among the artistic nations of the world,
there can be none as to his place as a craftsman.
In prehistoric days he was already the finest
flint-worker that the world has ever known, so
that his flint knives are to this day the standards
by which all other similar work falls to be tested,
and in presence of which it always comes short;
while his vessels of hard stone were shaped, with
a skill and a patience which to us seem little
short of marvellous, into shapes of grace and
beauty which have never been surpassed by
the workers of any land or time. Later he
translated these into fine pottery, and was always
a skilful and satisfying potter, though his work
never perhaps attained the grace and beauty of
that of his brother craftsman over the sea in
Crete. His greatest gift to us in this respect was
his development of the art of covering pottery of
all kinds with the exquisite glazes which still
charm us on scarabs, amulets, ushabti figures,
and all sorts of vessels.</p>

<p>As a linen worker, of course, he was incomparable,
and the finest specimens of modern
linen look wretchedly coarse when viewed under
a microscope alongside the best products of his
loom. The earliest jewellery of the world was
of his workmanship, and the bracelets of the
Ist Dynasty queen found at Abydos show us
that the Egyptian jeweller of six thousand years
ago needed no lessons from any of the most skilled
modern practitioners of the crafts. Indeed, all
through the history of the land the craftsmanship
of the goldsmith was beyond reproach. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
later periods his design was much inferior to the
happy inspirations of the morning of art, though
his technique was fairly well maintained to the
end; but in the best days of the craft, which
pretty closely correspond to the best days of
the history, design and technique were alike
admirable.</p>

<p>Anything finer in their own way than the
diadems of Khnumit, the royal crown, or the
pectorals of the Lahun treasure, it is impossible
to imagine, while if the standard of the furniture
in the tomb of Tutankhamen is maintained by
the jewellery, we may look for evidence from this
source that the skill of the craftsman had not
degenerated in the interval between the Middle
Kingdom and the New Empire.</p>

<p>With regard to woodwork, the evidence of the
furniture which has been found in the tombs is
conclusive both as to the skilful and sound design
of the Egyptian cabinet-maker, and as to his
careful and accurate workmanship. The chairs,
the coffers, and the couches from the tomb of
Yuaa and Tuau are delightful to the eye, with
their simple and sensible lines, and suggest that
they would be equally satisfactory in use. The
wonders which have been disclosed in the tomb
of Tutankhamen have already been discussed
in their own place, so far as that is possible at
present, and while they reveal nothing new, save
the ugly and clumsy state couches, whose
provenance has been also discussed, they show
an amount of richness in detail and material
for which even previous discoveries had scarcely
prepared us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p>Professor Petrie tells us that structurally the
work of the Egyptian joiner was as good as it
was satisfying to the eye, and the state in which
his works have come down to us through so many
centuries bears witness to the soundness of the
materials which he used, and of the work which
he put out upon them; and perhaps the carefully
moderate estimate of so great an expert is more
impressive as to the quality of Egyptian craftsmanship
than the multiplication of superlatives
would be. “The powerful technical skill of
Egyptian art, its good sense of limitations, and its
true feeling for harmony and expression, will
always make it of the first importance to the
countries of the West with which it was so early
and so long connected.”</p>

<p>In sum the debt which the modern world
owes to the culture of ancient Egypt is no small
one. We owe to Egypt the first book, the first
building, the first ship, the first statue, the first
romance, the first relief, and the first picture, in
the modern sense, of which we have any
knowledge; and if some of these anticipations
are crude and primitive, and show but little sign
of the wonderful development of which the
future was to prove them capable, yet it is only
due to this pioneer nation to remember that it
is to her that we owe the seed which has borne
so manifold a harvest.</p>
